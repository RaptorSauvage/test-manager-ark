 * found by actually hitting the failure this avoids, not by reading electron-store's source
 * first: running the packaged SEA binary standalone (no `node_modules`/`package.json` nearby,
 * unlike running from this source tree where `conf`'s own fallback happens to find one) threw
 * "Project name could not be inferred" from deep inside `conf`, because with `ipcMain`
 * undefined the real electron-store skips straight past `app.getPath('userData')` to that
 * fallback regardless of what this shim's `app` returns. A one-method `ipcMain` stub (just
 * enough to satisfy electron-store's own internal `ipcMain.on('electron-store-get-data', ...)`
 * registration, never actually invoked since there's no separate renderer process here) is
 * enough to make it take the `app.getPath('userData')` path instead.
