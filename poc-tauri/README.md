# Tauri shell PoC

Answers one question before committing to a real Electron → Tauri migration: can a Rust shell
spawn and talk to a persistent Node sidecar running the **existing, unmodified** application
logic, and get a real result back into a Tauri webview through an ordinary `invoke()` call?

This is scoped to exactly that round trip, now covering the actual headline case as well as the
supporting ones: a plain read (`profiles.list`), a write with parameters (`profiles.save`), two
independent push sources proving the mechanism generalizes (`profiles-changed` wrapping
`store.ts`'s own `profileEvents`, `manager-log-entry` wrapping `lib/managerLog.ts`'s own
`managerLogEvents`) - and now the real per-server **live console feed** itself
(`console.backlog`/`console.watch`, via `serverProcess.ts`'s real `watchLogFile` and
`lib/logEvents.ts`'s real `parseLogChunkWithDate`, both unmodified), which is what all of the
above was standing in for. All of that is Rust calling the sidecar; `folders_open_profiles`
proves the **other direction** too - the sidecar calling back into Rust for a real native action
(`lib/systemFolders.ts`'s real `openProfilesFolder()`, via Electron's `shell.openPath`) and
getting a real result back, over the same stdio pipe - see "The reverse direction" below.
`bot_start`/`bot_stop`/`bot_status` go beyond the main-process logic entirely: the real,
unmodified Discord bot subsystem (`lib/discordBot.ts` + `src/bot/`), which turned out to need no
porting work at all - and surfaced a genuinely significant SEA-packaging limitation along the
way, see "The Discord bot subsystem" below. `dashboard_start`/`dashboard_stop`/
`dashboard_status` prove the third and last subsystem from the original size estimate - the web
dashboard (`lib/webDashboard.ts`) - confirmed with a real HTTP client against the real embedded
dashboard page and the real `/api/servers` endpoint, see "The web dashboard subsystem" below.
Everything above is business logic; `manager-log.html` answers a different question - does the
real **UI** run against this architecture - by mounting the real, unmodified
`src/renderer/src/pages/ManagerLogView.tsx` against a `window.api` shim backed by Tauri instead
of Electron's `contextBridge`, see "A real React page" below. Window chrome, the menu bar, the
tray, the rest of the real renderer (`App.tsx`, routing, ~30 other pages), and the other ~34 IPC
modules in `src/main/ipc/` are still deliberately out of scope.

## What's here

- `src-tauri/` - a minimal Tauri 2 app, using `tauri-plugin-shell`'s real sidecar mechanism (not
  a hand-rolled `std::process::Command`) to spawn the sidecar on startup - see "Sidecar
  packaging" below. `src/main.rs` keeps a background async task reading the sidecar's stdout
  that routes each line either to the pending `call()` it answers (has an `"id"`), a
  `"shell-request"` (the sidecar calling back into Rust - see "The reverse direction" below), or
  out to the webview as an ordinary Tauri event (any other `"event"`), and exposes fifty-five
  Tauri commands: `profiles_list`, `profiles_save` (takes a profile object), `profiles_copy`/
  `profiles_move` (take `profileId`/`destInstallDir`/`newName` - see "A second real page" below),
  `log_record` (takes a message string), `manager_log_get_all` (see "A real React page" below),
  `server_start`/`server_stop`/`server_restart`/`server_kill`/`server_update`/`server_status`
  (all take a `profileId` - see "A fifth real page" below for `restart`/`kill`/`update`) and
  `server_install_test_executable` (test-only - see "The actual headline case" below),
  `console_backlog`/`console_watch` (both take an `installDir`),
  `console_append_test_line` (test-only - see below), `folders_open_profiles`,
  `bot_start`/`bot_stop`/`bot_status` (see "The Discord bot subsystem" below),
  `dashboard_start`/`dashboard_stop`/`dashboard_status` (see "The web dashboard subsystem"
  below), `dialog_select_directory` - the first command with no sidecar involvement at all,
  calling `tauri-plugin-dialog` straight from Rust (see "A second real page" below), and, for
  player management (see "A third real page" and "A fourth real page" below),
  `player_roster_list`/`player_roster_kick`/`player_bans_ban`/
  `player_whitelist_list`/`player_whitelist_add`/`player_whitelist_remove` plus `window_focus` -
  the second command with no
  sidecar involvement, backing `confirmAction()`'s real window-focus-loss workaround. The fifth
  real page (see below) added `settings_get`/`settings_save`, `profiles_delete`/
  `profiles_reorder`, and `system_stats_get_static_info`/`system_stats_get_network_usage`. The
  sixth (see below) added `stats_history_get`, `backup_get_schedule_status`,
  `server_get_installed_build_id`/`server_get_game_version`, `steamcmd_get_latest_build_id`, and
  `system_open_server_config_folder`/`system_open_server_saved_arks_folder`/
  `system_open_server_save_games_folder`. The seventh (see "A seventh real page" below) added
  `backup_create`/`backup_list`/`backup_delete`/`backup_restore`/`backup_open_folder`/
  `backup_get_log` and `player_backup_list_folders`/`player_backup_list`/
  `player_backup_open_folder`. The eighth (see "An eighth real page" below) added
  `steamcmd_get_update_log` and `steamcmd_append_test_update_log_line` (test-only).
- `sidecar/sidecar.ts` - a newline-delimited-JSON RPC server over stdin/stdout. Imports
  `listProfiles`/`saveProfile`/`profileEvents` from **the real, untouched `src/main/store.ts`**,
  `logManagerEvent`/`managerLogEvents` from **the real, untouched
  `src/main/lib/managerLog.ts`**, `watchLogFile`/`getLogFilePath`/`startServer`/`stopServer`/
  `getStatus`/`serverEvents`/`getExecutablePath`/`adoptPersistedProcesses` (from
  **`src/main/lib/serverProcess.ts`**, 980 lines - see "The actual headline case" and "Surviving
  a crash" below), `getRunningPids`/`getRunningStartedAt` (from **the same, already-imported
  `src/main/store.ts`**) plus `readLogBacklog`/`parseLogChunkWithDate`/
  `createLogEventCaches` (from **`src/main/lib/logEvents.ts`**), `openProfilesFolder` (from
  **`src/main/lib/systemFolders.ts`**), `copyProfile`/`moveProfile` (from
  **`src/main/lib/profileCopyMove.ts`**, see "A second real page" below),
  `sendRconCommand`/`parsePlayerListWithIds` (from **`src/main/lib/rcon.ts`**),
  `recordPlayerBan`/`listWhitelistedPlayers`/`recordWhitelistedPlayer`/
  `removeWhitelistedPlayerProfile` (from the same,
  already-imported **`src/main/store.ts`** - see "A third real page" below),
  `startDiscordBot`/`stopDiscordBot`/
  `getDiscordBotStatus` (from **`src/main/lib/discordBot.ts`**, see "The Discord bot subsystem"
  below), and `applyWebDashboardSettings`/`stopWebDashboard`/`getWebDashboardStatus` (from
  **`src/main/lib/webDashboard.ts`**, 8200+ lines, see "The web dashboard subsystem" below) -
  none of it stubs or rewrites; every emitter is wired
  straight to a push-event line (`profiles-changed`, `manager-log-entry`, `console-line`,
  `server-status`), so
  every real write's/parsed log line's/status change's side effect reaches the webview the same way it would via
  Electron's `webContents.send`. `sidecar/electronShim.ts` stands in for the Electron APIs that
  import chain actually calls directly (`app.getPath`, a minimal `ipcMain` stub `electron-store`
  itself needs, and `shell.openPath` - see "Findings" below and "The reverse direction" below) -
  see "electron-store's own fallback" below for a wrinkle this found and a real crash it caused
  once genuinely installed. `sidecar/rpcToRust.ts` holds the small bit of plumbing
  `shell.openPath` needs to call back into Rust over the same stdio pipe (see "The reverse
  direction"). `sidecar/build.mjs` bundles it all with esbuild, aliasing `electron` → the shim
  and pointing esbuild at the project's own `tsconfig.node.json` (see "Findings" below for why),
  into a single dependency-free `dist/sidecar.cjs`. `sidecar/sea-config.json` +
  `sidecar/build-sea.mjs` turn that bundle into `dist/sidecar-bin` - a standalone executable
  with Node itself embedded, via Node's own SEA (Single Executable Applications) feature - so
  `main.rs` can spawn it directly with no `node` on the target machine at all (see "Sidecar
  packaging" below). `sidecar/build-bot.mjs` separately bundles the real, unmodified
  `src/bot/index.ts` (mirroring the real repo's own `scripts/build-bot.mjs`) into
  `sidecar/bot/index.js`, the exact relative path `lib/discordBot.ts`'s own `botScriptPath()`
  expects; `sidecar/build-bot-sea.mjs` packages that into its own separate SEA binary,
  `sidecar/bot/bot-bin` - see "The Discord bot subsystem" below for why. The web dashboard
  needed no separate build step at all - `webDashboard.ts` is just
  another file `sidecar/build.mjs`'s existing esbuild bundle already pulls in.
- `frontend/index.html` - a bare page (not the real React UI): calls `invoke('profiles_list')`
  on load; buttons call `invoke('profiles_save', { profile })`, `invoke('log_record', {
  message })`, `invoke('console_watch', { installDir })`, `invoke('console_append_test_line',
  { installDir, message })`, `invoke('server_install_test_executable')`/`invoke('server_start')`/
  `invoke('server_stop')`/`invoke('server_status')` (see "The actual headline case" below),
  `invoke('folders_open_profiles')`, `invoke('bot_start')`/
  `invoke('bot_stop')`/`invoke('bot_status')`, and `invoke('dashboard_start')`/
  `invoke('dashboard_stop')`/`invoke('dashboard_status')`; `listen('profiles-changed',
  ...)`/`listen('manager-log-entry', ...)`/`listen('console-line', ...)`/`listen('server-status',
  ...)` handlers update their
  own section the moment each push event arrives - independent of any button, proving the
  live-update path for all four. `frontend/manager-log.html` +
  `frontend/manager-log-entry.tsx` are different: not hand-written for this PoC at all, beyond a
  tiny `window.api` shim - they mount the real, unmodified
  `src/renderer/src/pages/ManagerLogView.tsx` - see "A real React page" below.
  `frontend/profile-management.html` + `frontend/profile-management-entry.tsx` do the same for
  the real, unmodified `src/renderer/src/pages/ProfileManagementView.tsx` - see "A second real
  page" below. `frontend/player-roster.html` + `frontend/player-roster-entry.tsx` do the same
  for the real, unmodified `src/renderer/src/pages/PlayerRosterPanel.tsx` - see "A third real
  page" below. `frontend/player-whitelist.html` + `frontend/player-whitelist-entry.tsx` do the
  same for the real, unmodified `src/renderer/src/pages/PlayerWhitelistPanel.tsx` - see "A
  fourth real page" below. `frontend/build-react.mjs` bundles all four entries with esbuild (JSX
  support, the same `@shared/*` alias handling as the other build scripts).

## Running it

```sh
node sidecar/build-bot.mjs      # bundles sidecar/bot/index.js (needed before the first bot_start call)
node sidecar/build-bot-sea.mjs  # optional: packages that as sidecar/bot/bot-bin (fixes SEA + fork(), see below)
node sidecar/build.mjs          # bundles sidecar/dist/sidecar.cjs
node sidecar/build-sea.mjs      # builds dist/sidecar-bin AND copies it into src-tauri/binaries/
node frontend/build-react.mjs   # bundles manager-log.js (needed before opening manager-log.html)
cd src-tauri && cargo build     # or: cargo tauri dev, if the Tauri CLI is installed
./target/debug/tauri_poc_shell
```

`build-bot-sea.mjs` is optional - skip it and `bot_start` falls back to `discordBot.ts`'s normal
`fork()` behavior, which leaks a duplicate idle sidecar process instead of running the bot (see
"The Discord bot subsystem"); run it, and `main.rs` picks up `sidecar/bot/bot-bin` automatically
if it exists at build time, no extra flag needed.

`build-sea.mjs` is **not optional** before the first `cargo build`: `tauri.conf.json` declares
`bundle.externalBin: ["binaries/sidecar-bin"]`, and Tauri's own build script checks that
`src-tauri/binaries/sidecar-bin-<target-triple>` exists *at `cargo build` time*, not just at
runtime - `cargo build` fails outright (`resource path ... doesn't exist`) if that file is
missing, before any of this PoC's own code even runs. Re-run `build-sea.mjs` whenever
`sidecar.ts` changes; `cargo build` doesn't need to re-run unless `main.rs`/`Cargo.toml`
changed too, since Tauri just copies whatever's already in `binaries/`.

Set `SIDECAR_PATH` to a `node <path>`-style path (pointing at `dist/sidecar.cjs`) to skip all
of that and run the sidecar straight through a locally-installed `node` during iteration - no
`cargo build` needed at all when only `sidecar.ts` changes, and no `binaries/` setup required
first. `main.rs` reads this env var at startup, not compile time, and spawns it through the
plugin's generic `command()` API instead of `sidecar()` when it's set (see "Sidecar packaging").

Linux build needs `libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev`, `libgtk-3-dev`, `librsvg2-dev`, `libsoup-3.0-dev`,
`libjavascriptcoregtk-4.1-dev`, `libxdo-dev`, `libssl-dev`, `libayatana-appindicator3-dev`, and
the usual `build-essential`. Windows needs Rust (via rustup), the "Desktop development with
C++" workload from the Visual Studio Build Tools (the MSVC linker - plain VS Code is not
enough, confirmed by actually hitting `error: linker 'link.exe' not found` without it), and
WebView2 (present by default on Windows 10 21H2+/11).

`icons/icon.ico` has to exist alongside `icons/icon.png` - found by actually building on
Windows, where `tauri-build` needs it (by that exact conventional path) to generate the
`.exe`'s Windows Resource file; the Linux build never asked for it because WebKitGTK has no
equivalent step. Regenerated here with `convert icon.png -define
icon:auto-resize=256,128,64,48,32,16 icon.ico` (ImageMagick).

To build and install a real package instead of just running the dev binary (`cargo install
tauri-cli --version "^2.0.0"` once, then):

```sh
cd src-tauri && cargo tauri build --bundles deb   # needs build-sea.mjs run first, same as above
sudo dpkg -i target/release/bundle/deb/tauri-poc-shell_0.1.0_amd64.deb
```

See "Actually bundled and installed with `cargo tauri build`" below before trusting a `cargo
build` dev run alone - it hid a real crash-on-install bug that only the actual bundle surfaced.

## Result

**Confirmed on real Windows (WebView2), not just this Linux sandbox:** the window opens clean
(dark background, correct icon, no white flash), the read path shows "Got 0 profile(s)..." on
load, and clicking "Save a test profile" **visually** updates the push-status line to the live
'profiles-changed' confirmation with the new entry in the list - the one thing the Linux/Xvfb
run below couldn't show directly. That closes the last open question from this PoC: the full
read + write + push round trip works end to end, through a real OS-provided webview, not just
through on-disk evidence.

**The read path** (`profiles_list`) is confirmed both by screenshot and by watching it run: the
webview calls `invoke('profiles_list')` → Rust writes a JSON-RPC request to the sidecar's stdin
→ the sidecar runs the real `listProfiles()` (full `electron-store` load, migrations,
everything `store.ts` normally does) → the response comes back over stdout → Rust resolves the
pending call → the webview renders it.

**The write + push path** (`profiles_save` → real `saveProfile()` → real `profileEvents`
→ `profiles-changed` event → the webview's `listen()` handler) was first confirmed on this
Linux sandbox by the resulting on-disk state rather than a screenshot (see "A rendering dead
end" below for why), then confirmed visually for real on Windows/WebView2 as noted above.
Triggering the button's handler on a timer and checking `~/.config/ark-server-manager-
nodejs/config.json` afterward showed the new profile, written with a timestamp matching that
exact run, through `saveProfile`'s *full* migration/defaulting pipeline (`queryPort`,
`maxPlayers`, every other field `migrateProfile` normally fills in) - not a partial or
stubbed write.

No code in `src/main/store.ts` was changed for any of this - only `app.getPath('documents')`
needed a stand-in to run outside Electron (see `electronShim.ts`).

**The live console feed** - the actual headline case, not a stand-in for it - is confirmed the
same way: a synthetic ShooterGame.log-shaped file (no real ARK server in this sandbox) run
through the real `readLogBacklog` for the backlog, then the real `watchLogFile` polling + real
`parseLogChunkWithDate` parsing for the live feed. A scripted standalone test (spawn the
sidecar, send `console.watch`, wait past one real poll tick, send
`console.appendTestLine`, wait past the next tick) produced exactly one `console-line` push
event, correctly parsed as a `CHAT` entry with the right player name and timestamp - the real
regex-based parser (the same one the desktop Console tab and Web Dashboard both already use),
not a simplified one written for this PoC. The Tauri command wiring (`console_backlog`/
`console_watch`/`console_append_test_line`) compiles and the app starts cleanly with it, but -
unlike `profiles_save` - wasn't separately re-verified through a live button click on Windows,
since it's structurally identical to that already-Windows-confirmed command (same `call()`
path, same param-passing shape); the sidecar-level logic underneath it is what's actually new,
and that's what got the scripted test.

**Later update - now also confirmed live through the real webview on Linux, not just
standalone.** `index.html`'s own `listen('console-line', ...)` handler was never actually
re-tested after "A fifth real page" found and fixed the missing `capabilities/default.json`
(every `listen()` call in this PoC, `console-line` included, was being silently rejected until
then - see that section). Clicked "Start watching the test log," waited past one real 2-second
poll tick, clicked "Simulate a server writing a line," and the real feed updated live on screen:
"Live line received via 'console-line' push event," with the real parsed `CHAT` entry prepended
to the list - closing the one push-event type in this PoC that had only ever been confirmed
standalone.

Screenshot of the read path (Linux, WebKitGTK, via Xvfb - `Got 0 profile(s)` because this
sandbox has no real profiles.json, not because anything failed):

`Tauri shell PoC - real store.ts through a Node sidecar` / `Got 0 profile(s) from the real
store.ts, via the Rust shell -> Node sidecar round trip.`

### The reverse direction (sidecar calling Rust)

Everything above is one direction: Rust calls the sidecar, the sidecar answers or pushes
events. Real lib files that call Electron's `shell.*` (`systemFolders.ts`, `backup.ts`,
`mapManagement.ts`, ...) need the opposite direction too - `shell.openPath` is a native "open
this in the system file manager" call only the Rust shell can actually make, so the sidecar has
to ask Rust to do it and wait for a real answer, not fire-and-forget. Grepping every real call
site (`grep -rn "shell\.\(openPath\|showItemInFolder\)" src/main/lib/`) turned up only
`shell.openPath`, always in the same `await`-and-check-the-error-string shape, across 7 call
sites in 6 files - `showItemInFolder` isn't used anywhere, so that's the one method this needed
to prove.

**Architecture**: reuses the exact same bidirectional stdio pipe instead of opening a second
channel. `electronShim.ts`'s `shell.openPath(path)` calls `rpcToRust.ts`'s `callRust()`, which
sends a push-event-shaped line out on stdout (`{event: "shell-request", data: {id, method,
params}}` - using the event-name slot, not the RPC-method slot, since the sidecar is the one
initiating this time) and returns a `Promise` that resolves when a matching response arrives
back on stdin. `main.rs`'s reader task now recognizes `event === "shell-request"` specially:
instead of forwarding it to the webview like any other push event, it calls the real
`tauri-plugin-opener` crate (`app_handle.opener().open_path(path, None)`) and writes a plain
`{id, result}`/`{id, error}` line back onto the sidecar's own stdin - indistinguishable on the
wire from a response to an RPC call *Rust* itself made, except it's a separate id
counter/pending map going the other way, and `sidecar.ts`'s own line handler tells the two
apart by one rule: a line with a `"method"` field is a command from Rust, a line without one is
a response to one of the sidecar's own outgoing requests.

This needed `SidecarHandle.child` to become an `Arc<Mutex<CommandChild>>` shared between the
code that writes outgoing RPC requests and the reader task that now also writes shell-request
responses, both onto the same stdin.

**Proven real, not a mocked test, by porting an actual real file**: `folders_open_profiles`
calls `sidecar.ts`'s `folders.openProfiles` RPC method, which calls the real, unmodified
`openProfilesFolder()` from `lib/systemFolders.ts` - not a synthetic test method standing in
for the mechanism. That function itself calls `shell.openPath` internally; this PoC's code
never calls `shell.openPath` directly.

**Confirmed three ways**, each isolating a different layer:
1. A standalone Node script spawning `dist/sidecar.cjs` directly and acting as a fake Rust
   peer (reading the outgoing `shell-request` line, writing back a synthetic `{id, result:
   true}` response) confirmed the TypeScript side's id-correlation and promise resolution, for
   both the success and error-propagation paths, with no Rust involved at all.
2. Running the actual compiled Tauri app under Xvfb and clicking (via a temporary `setTimeout`
   trigger, reverted before committing) confirmed the real round trip end to end: Rust's stderr
   logged `sidecar shell-request 'openPath' -> Err("Launcher \"gio\" \"open\"
   \"/root/.tauri-poc-bober-manager\" failed with ExitStatus(unix_wait_status(512))")` - a real
   attempt by the real `tauri-plugin-opener` crate to run `gio open` against the real path
   `electronShim.ts`'s `app.getPath('userData')` resolves to, failing only because this headless
   sandbox has no GUI session/file manager registered to handle it (the same category of
   sandbox-specific gap as the WebKitGTK rendering limitation below, not an architecture bug).
3. The error correctly reached all the way back down through `write_line` → the sidecar's
   stdin → `resolveRustResponse` → the rejected `callRust()` promise → `shell.openPath`
   returning that message as a string (matching real Electron's own `shell.openPath` contract)
   → `openProfilesFolder()` throwing it → the RPC response's `error` field → the webview's
   `.catch()` handler, which is the complete real error-propagation path a real migration needs,
   not just the happy path.

This Rust-side `eprintln!` logging of every shell-request's outcome was kept in `main.rs`
(not reverted) - genuinely useful visibility into a native call that has no other feedback
path from inside this architecture.

### The Discord bot subsystem (a real packaging bug, found and fixed)

Everything above is the "main process logic" sidecar. The original size/migration estimate also
counted two more real subsystems - the Discord bot and the web dashboard - as separate sidecars,
listed in "What this doesn't prove yet" as completely untouched. This proves the bot one, and
the result was better *and* worse than expected: better, because it needed **zero porting work**
at all; worse, because it surfaced a real, consequential bug in this PoC's own SEA packaging
that the main-process sidecar's own tests never would have caught.

**Better than expected - already decoupled.** `grep -rl "from 'electron'" src/bot/` returns
nothing: the bot (`src/bot/`, ~3000 lines, `discord.js`) has zero Electron imports. It already
runs as its own OS process today, `fork()`ed by `lib/discordBot.ts` with `ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE=1`
specifically so it can't take the Manager down if it crashes, talking to the Manager purely over
the existing Web Dashboard HTTP API - not Electron IPC at all. `sidecar/build-bot.mjs` bundles
`src/bot/index.ts` completely unmodified (same esbuild config as the real repo's own
`scripts/build-bot.mjs`) into `sidecar/bot/index.js`, and `sidecar.ts`'s `bot.start`/`bot.stop`/
`bot.status` RPC methods call the real, unmodified `startDiscordBot()`/`stopDiscordBot()`/
`getDiscordBotStatus()` from `lib/discordBot.ts` directly - no shim, no stub, no new glue beyond
the three one-line RPC methods themselves. `startDiscordBot()` round-trips through the real
`saveSettings()`/`getSettings()` (flipping `discordBotEnabled`/`discordBotToken` on, the same
shape the real Settings UI would send) and reuses the exact same `manager-log-entry` push event
already proven for `log.record` - `discordBot.ts`'s own `logManagerEvent` calls on start/exit
reached the webview with no new wiring at all.

**Confirmed under `SIDECAR_PATH` dev mode** (plain `node`, not the SEA binary): a standalone
script acting as a fake Rust peer showed the complete real lifecycle - `bot.start` → real
`fork()` → the real bundled bot process actually starts, reads its config, attempts
`client.login()` against Discord's real gateway, and (no outbound DNS to discord.com in this
sandbox) fails with `getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND discord.com`, exiting cleanly with code 1. That
exit is caught by `discordBot.ts`'s own real `proc.on('exit', ...)` handler, which pushes a
second real `manager-log-entry` event and updates `lastError` - all unmodified code, reproduced
through the real compiled Tauri app running under Xvfb (checked via the real
`~/Documents/.../logs/manager.jsonl` file, not a screenshot, for the same reason as "A rendering
dead end" below): `"Démarrage du bot Discord..."` then `"Le bot Discord s'est arrêté (code 1)."`,
exactly matching the standalone result.

**Worse than expected - a real bug, found by running the actually-installed thing, not the dev
build** (same lesson as "Actually bundled and installed with `cargo tauri build`" above, this
time without even needing `cargo tauri build` - the plain dev binary already showed it once
pointed at the default SEA sidecar instead of `SIDECAR_PATH`): calling `bot.start` against the
**default** sidecar (the compiled SEA binary, not `SIDECAR_PATH` dev mode) spawns a process that
prints `sidecar: ready` - the *main sidecar's own* startup banner, not anything from
`sidecar/bot/index.js` - and then just sits there, alive, doing nothing, forever. Confirmed with
a minimal, decisive test: running `./sidecar-bin /path/to/bot/index.js /path/to/config.json`
directly (extra positional args most Node programs would treat as `process.argv`) behaves
identically to running `./sidecar-bin` with no arguments at all. **Node's SEA packaging bakes in
one fixed entry point and ignores any script-path argument entirely** - there is no way to tell
a SEA binary "run this other file instead." `fork()`'s whole mechanism is built on the opposite
assumption (re-execute `process.execPath` with a *different* module path as the first argument),
so `lib/discordBot.ts`'s `fork(botScriptPath(), [configPath], ...)` - completely correct, and
exactly how every other Node program spawns a worker script - silently does the wrong thing the
moment `process.execPath` is a SEA binary instead of a real `node`: it leaks a second, idle copy
of the *main* sidecar process instead of running the bot, with no error anywhere (not even in
`discordBot.ts`'s own `proc.on('error', ...)` handler - `fork()` itself reports success, because
from the OS's perspective a process genuinely did start).

This is a materially different kind of finding than everything above: not a config quirk or
a sandbox limitation, but a real architectural incompatibility between two pieces of this PoC
that each work fine on their own - Node SEA packaging (proven solid for the main sidecar) and
`fork()`-based worker spawning (proven solid as *application code*, unmodified, under `node`).

**Fixed and validated, not just diagnosed** - this is the one place in the whole PoC where a
real `src/main/lib/` file needed an actual code change, not just a shim or new RPC glue, so it's
worth being explicit about exactly what changed and why. `lib/discordBot.ts`'s `fork()` call now
checks an optional `BOT_LAUNCH_COMMAND` environment variable first: unset (every normal build,
including every real Electron build - Electron's own executable is never a SEA binary), nothing
changes at all, same `fork(botScriptPath(), ...)` as before; set, it calls
`spawn(launchCommand, [configPath], { stdio: [..., 'ipc'], env: {...} })` instead - an explicit
path to spawn rather than an implicit re-exec of `process.execPath`, with the `'ipc'` stdio slot
so `child.send()`/the exit/stdout/stderr handling all keep working exactly as `fork()` already
provided them. Fifteen lines, reviewed against the existing test suite (`npx vitest run
tests/discordBot.test.ts`: 16/16 still pass) and `npx tsc --noEmit -p tsconfig.node.json` (clean)
before being trusted.

`sidecar/build-bot-sea.mjs` packages the bot (`sidecar/bot/index.js`) as its own separate SEA
binary (`sidecar/bot/bot-bin`), the same `--experimental-sea-config`/`postject` steps as
`build-sea.mjs` uses for the main sidecar, and copies it to
`src-tauri/binaries/bot-bin-<target-triple>`. `tauri.conf.json`'s `bundle.externalBin` now lists
`"binaries/bot-bin"` alongside `"binaries/sidecar-bin"` - the real mechanism this time, not the
dev-only `CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR` shortcut an earlier version of this fix used (which would have
resolved to a source-tree path that doesn't exist once genuinely installed, quietly leaving
`bot_start` broken again the moment anyone actually shipped a bundle). `main.rs`'s
`spawn_sidecar` now resolves `bot-bin`'s real location the same way `tauri-plugin-shell`'s own
(private) sidecar-path resolution does internally - `std::env::current_exe()?.parent()?.join(...)`
- replicated by hand since there's no public API to ask for a resolved path without spawning, and
confirmed by reading the plugin's own source rather than guessing. Only passed as
`BOT_LAUNCH_COMMAND` when that file actually exists, so a plain `cargo build` without ever
running `build-bot-sea.mjs` still works exactly as before (confirmed: removed `bot-bin`,
rebuilt, ran clean).

**Confirmed fixed through the real, compiled app, both in dev mode and as a genuinely installed
package - not just standalone.** Dev mode: `cargo build` copies `binaries/bot-bin-<triple>` to a
plain `bot-bin` right next to `target/debug/tauri_poc_shell`, confirmed on disk before even
running anything; then, with no manual env vars set, `bot_start` against the **default SEA
sidecar** showed the real bot's own distinctive log line (`"Connexion à Discord impossible :
getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND discord.com"`, timestamped, not `"sidecar: ready"`) in `manager.jsonl`,
followed by a clean exit and no leaked process - the same correct behavior `SIDECAR_PATH` dev
mode always had, now also working under the packaging mode that actually ships. Then
`cargo tauri build --bundles deb` (87 MiB now, two embedded Node runtimes): `dpkg --contents`
confirmed `usr/bin/bot-bin` genuinely inside the package next to `usr/bin/sidecar-bin`, and after
a real `dpkg -i` install, running `/usr/bin/bot-bin` directly (standalone, the exact binary the
installed app would resolve to) reproduced the identical real failure - the same evidence
`Command::env()` receives the right path either way, dev or installed, from the same
`current_exe()`-relative logic.

### The web dashboard subsystem

The third and last subsystem from the original size estimate. `lib/webDashboard.ts` is big
(8200+ lines) and pulls in a large slice of `src/main/lib/` transitively (`serverActions.ts`,
`backup.ts`, `rcon.ts`, `groupConsole.ts`, `statsHistory.ts`, `fileBrowser.ts`, ...) - it's the
real app's entire Web Dashboard HTTP API and embedded frontend in one file, not a small
single-purpose module like the others this PoC has ported so far.

**Architecturally different from the bot in one important way, confirmed by just reading it
rather than assuming**: unlike the bot, the web dashboard was never a separate OS process even
in the real app - `startWebDashboard()`/`stopWebDashboard()` just create a plain
`http.Server`/`https.Server` (Node's own built-in modules) **in the same process** as
everything else, listening on a port directly. There's no `fork()` anywhere in this file, so
none of "The Discord bot subsystem"'s SEA-packaging problem applies here at all - this is just
more functions this sidecar can call, the same shape as `systemFolders.ts`.

**Added to `sidecar.ts` and it bundled clean on the first try** - no missing-module errors, no
new Electron-shim gaps (the existing `app.getPath` coverage was already enough), despite the
large transitive import graph. `dashboard.start`/`dashboard.stop`/`dashboard.status` call the
real, unmodified `applyWebDashboardSettings()`/`stopWebDashboard()`/`getWebDashboardStatus()`
directly, through the same real `saveSettings()`/`getSettings()` round trip as every other real
subsystem this PoC touches.

**Confirmed the most thoroughly of anything in this PoC, because it's the one subsystem a real
HTTP client can check without any webview/Xvfb involvement at all.** Standalone (a fake-Rust-peer
script, same technique as "The reverse direction"): `dashboard.start` → a real `http.Server`
actually listening on `127.0.0.1:18090` → a real `GET /api/servers` returns `200` with a real
`[]` (correctly empty, no profiles exist) → a real `GET /` returns the real embedded dashboard
page (`<title>Bober Server Manager - Web Console</title>`, not a stand-in) → `dashboard.stop` →
a follow-up request gets a real `ECONNREFUSED`, proving the server genuinely stopped, not just
that the RPC call returned. Then reproduced through the **actual compiled Tauri app**, started
for real (`./target/debug/tauri_poc_shell`, default sidecar - the SEA binary, not
`SIDECAR_PATH`), triggered via `invoke('dashboard_start')`, and checked with a plain `curl` from
a completely separate terminal, entirely outside the app: `curl http://127.0.0.1:18090/`
returned the real dashboard HTML, `curl http://127.0.0.1:18090/api/servers` returned the real
`[]`. This sidesteps "A rendering dead end" below entirely - no screenshot, no on-disk-state
proxy, no WebKitGTK repaint question at all, just an ordinary HTTP response from a real server
running inside the real app.

Unlike the Discord bot, **nothing broke here** - worth stating plainly rather than only ever
reporting bugs: a 8200-line file with a large transitive dependency graph, including several
subsystems this PoC hasn't touched directly yet (`serverActions.ts`, `backup.ts`, `rcon.ts`, the
group console, stats history, the file browser), bundled and ran correctly the first time it was
tried, serving real HTTP responses through every layer of this PoC's architecture (Rust shell →
sidecar → real app code → real HTTP server → real HTTP client) with zero new workarounds needed.

### A real React page

Every proof above is about the application logic underneath the UI - `frontend/index.html` has
always been a bare, hand-written page, not the real renderer, standing in for the question "does
the architecture carry a real call correctly," not "does the real UI work against it." This is
the first time that second question gets a real answer: can an actual, unmodified page from
`src/renderer/src/` run against a Tauri `window.api` shim instead of Electron's
`contextBridge`-exposed one?

**Picked `ManagerLogView.tsx`** (`src/renderer/src/pages/`, 146 lines) deliberately: it's small
and self-contained (no imports beyond React and a shared type), and it corresponds exactly to a
subsystem this PoC had already proven at the RPC layer (`log.record`/`manager-log-entry`), so
porting it tests the UI layer specifically, not a new backend capability bundled in with it. It
calls exactly two methods - `window.api.managerLog.getLog()` and
`window.api.managerLog.onLogChanged(callback)` - everything else in the file (its own grouping
logic, its own date/time formatting, its own JSX, its own CSS class names) is real, unmodified
production code.

**The port is almost entirely on the Rust/sidecar side, not the component.** `sidecar.ts` gained
one line (`'log.getAll': () => readManagerLog()`, the real, already-imported-from-the-same-file
function backing the real preload's `managerLogGet` IPC handler) and `main.rs` one matching
`manager_log_get_all` command. `poc-tauri/frontend/manager-log-entry.tsx` (new) defines a
`window.api` object with exactly the two methods `ManagerLogView.tsx` calls - `getLog` forwards
to `invoke('manager_log_get_all')`, `onLogChanged` forwards to
`listen('manager-log-entry', ...)` - then imports the real component unmodified and mounts it
with `createRoot`. `poc-tauri/frontend/build-react.mjs` bundles that entry with esbuild
(`jsx: 'automatic'`, the same `@shared/*` alias handling as the other build scripts) into
`manager-log.js`, served by Tauri as a second page (`manager-log.html`) alongside `index.html` -
`frontendDist` is a whole directory, so this needed no `tauri.conf.json` changes at all.

**Confirmed with real data, not an empty state.** Seeded a real entry into the real
`manager.jsonl` first (piping a `log.record` call directly into the SEA sidecar binary,
standalone), then pointed the app's main window at `manager-log.html` directly (a temporary
`tauri.conf.json` window `url` override, reverted immediately after) and screenshotted the
result under Xvfb. The real component rendered the real seeded entry correctly - its own
"Manager Log" header, its own description paragraph, its own task-grouping with the real
`taskLabel` ("Tauri PoC") and the exact seeded message text - all through `getLog()`'s real
`invoke` → Rust → sidecar → `readManagerLog()` → the real JSONL file round trip. This is a
first-frame screenshot (see "A rendering dead end" below for why that's the reliable one in this
sandbox), so it directly confirms the read path; the live-push path (`onLogChanged`) wasn't
separately re-screenshotted, since it's structurally identical to the already-proven
`listen('manager-log-entry', ...)` call `index.html`'s own vanilla-JS listener already uses -
the new code here is purely the `window.api` wrapper around it, not the event delivery itself.

This doesn't generalize to "the whole real UI runs on Tauri" by itself - one small, read-heavy
page is not the real `App.tsx` with its routing, Context providers, and ~30 other pages each
touching a different slice of `window.api`. What it does show is the actual *shape* of that
port: no change to the real component, a `window.api` object built to the same surface the real
preload already defines, and the Rust/sidecar side doing the same kind of one-line RPC-method
addition this whole PoC has done repeatedly elsewhere - not a rewrite of the UI layer, just
another thin transport swap underneath it.

### A rendering dead end (and why it doesn't undercut the result above)

Confirming the write+push path visually turned into its own small investigation. In order:

1. `xdotool click` at the button's screen coordinates did nothing - no error, no state change at
   all, not even a focus ring.
2. Focusing the window first and clicking by window-relative coordinates got a focus ring to
   appear on the button, but still no click handler firing.
3. Switched to triggering the save on a `setTimeout` instead of a real click, to isolate "is
   input simulation the problem" from "does the write+push path work" - still nothing changed
   on screen after waiting well past the timer.
4. That ruled out input simulation specifically, which pointed at something more fundamental:
   edited `frontend/index.html` **without** rebuilding the Rust binary first, assuming
   `frontendDist` is read live from disk. It isn't - Tauri embeds it at `cargo build` time, so
   every edit needs a rebuild before it's visible, which this PoC's own first few check-ins
   quietly got right only by accident (the README already said `cargo build` in "Running it").
   After rebuilding, the on-disk write started happening on schedule (see above) - the
   architecture worked the whole time.
5. What still never changed was the **screen**. Checked the actual file on disk (not the
   screenshot) and found the write already there, timestamped to the right second. So the
   webview's JS executed, `invoke`/the event listener both did their job, and the DOM almost
   certainly updated - but WebKitGTK never repainted the X window to reflect it. Tried
   `LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE=1` (cleared the DRI3/EGL warnings) and forcing a relayout via
   `xdotool windowsize` (a common repaint trigger) - neither changed the screenshot. The first
   frame painted correctly every time; nothing after that ever did.

Read together, this looks like a software-rendering compositing limit specific to WebKitGTK
under a bare Xvfb (no window manager, no real GPU) in this particular sandbox, not a problem
with the Tauri/sidecar architecture itself - the filesystem was a more reliable witness than a
screenshot here, and it said the write and the push event both landed. **Confirmed**: a real
Windows/WebView2 run showed the push-status line update live on screen after clicking the
button, exactly as expected - the gap this section describes was specific to this Linux
sandbox's rendering, not the architecture.

**Update - this conclusion doesn't generalize as broadly as stated above.** "A fourth real page,
and a correction to 'A rendering dead end'" (further down) found a real post-write repaint in
this same sandbox, using the same `setTimeout`-triggered approach step 3 above already tried.
The exact difference between the two tests was never isolated - treat "no repaint after the
first frame" as something to re-check with a fresh screenshot, not an assumption to build on.

**Second update - the real root cause, found in "A fifth real page" (further down): this was
never a WebKitGTK rendering limit at all.** `src-tauri/capabilities/` didn't exist - no
capabilities file had ever been created in this PoC - and Tauri 2 silently rejects
`window.__TAURI__.event.listen(...)` (the exact call this section's `pushStatusEl` handler and
every other live-update page in this PoC depends on) without one:
`event.listen not allowed. Permissions associated with this command: core:event:allow-listen,
core:event:default`. The write genuinely landed (confirmed on disk, as step 5 above found), but
the push event was never delivered to this page's JS at all - not "delivered but unpainted." This
also fully reconciles the apparent contradiction with the update above: "A fourth real page"'s
repaint-that-worked was triggered from a click handler's own `invoke()` response, never through
`listen()` - a completely different, never-blocked code path - which is exactly why it worked
while this section's `listen()`-dependent push did not. Fixed with
`capabilities/default.json`; re-running this exact scenario (a real click on "Save a test
profile") after the fix shows the live update correctly, on screen, in this same sandbox. See "A
fifth real page" for the full investigation.

### A second real page: write paths and a native dialog

`ManagerLogView.tsx` above was deliberately the easy case: read-only, one subsystem already
proven at the RPC layer, no native OS interaction. `ProfileManagementView.tsx`
(`src/renderer/src/pages/`, 165 lines) was picked next specifically because it isn't that - it's
a write path (copy/move an entire server install) with a native folder-picker dialog in front of
it, which is architecturally new territory for this PoC in two ways at once.

**The write side is the same shape as everything else.** `window.api.profiles.copy`/`.move` call
the real, unmodified `copyProfile()`/`moveProfile()` from `lib/profileCopyMove.ts` - a file with
zero Electron coupling already (confirmed earlier by reading it in full) - through two new
sidecar RPC methods (`profiles.copy`/`profiles.move`) and two matching `main.rs` commands
(`profiles_copy`/`profiles_move`), exactly the same `invoke → Rust → sidecar → real function`
shape `profiles_list`/`profiles_save` already proved. One deliberate scoping cut: the real
`ipc/profiles.ts` handler also re-runs `applyBackupSchedule`/`syncPlayerBackupWatch`/
`applyScheduledRestart`/`applyScheduledDinoWipe`/`applyScheduledRconCommands`/
`applyScheduledMaintenance` on the result, re-arming file watchers and cron-like timers against
the profile's new path - left out here since there's no real server process or backup content in
this sandbox to observe it against, and it isn't what this increment tests. A real migration
still has to port that wiring; it's the same kind of real file-copy/move operation as any other,
not a new question about the architecture.

**Confirmed against real files, not a mocked response.** Standalone, piping JSON-RPC lines
directly into the SEA sidecar binary (same technique as seeding `manager.jsonl` earlier): seeded
a profile pointing at `/tmp/poc-profile-src` (two real files in it), called `profiles.copy` with
a new destination, and confirmed on disk - not just in the RPC response - that
`/tmp/poc-profile-dest-copy` now contains byte-identical copies of both files and the source is
untouched. Then called `profiles.move`: the destination got the files, `newName` was reflected in
the result, and critically `/tmp/poc-profile-src` **no longer exists** - `fs.promises.rename`'s
real behavior, not a copy pretending to be a move. `config.json` (the real electron-store-backed
file) gained the new/renamed profile entries both times, through the exact same `saveProfile()`
this PoC's very first round already proved.

**The native dialog is the actually new architectural shape.** Every prior proof in this PoC -
`profiles.*`, `log.*`, `console.*`, the bot, the web dashboard - is a sidecar RPC call with Rust
as a thin passthrough. `window.api.dialog.selectDirectory()` isn't: the real `dialog.ts`
(`src/main/ipc/dialog.ts`, read in full earlier) calls Electron's `dialog.showOpenDialog`
directly against a `BrowserWindow` handle - it's a main-process/window-level concern in the real
app too, with zero business-logic file in between. So `dialog_select_directory` in `main.rs` is
the first command in this PoC with **no sidecar involvement at all**: a plain `#[tauri::command]`
calling `tauri-plugin-dialog`'s `app_handle.dialog().file().blocking_pick_folder()` straight from
Rust - matching the real app's own architecture rather than inventing a sidecar round trip for
something that was never routed through one.

**Confirmed: real data renders through both commands together.** Pointed the main window at a
new `profile-management.html` (same temporary-`tauri.conf.json`-`url`, reverted-after technique
as `manager-log.html`) and screenshotted under Xvfb. First attempt showed the dropdown populated
with the real seeded profile name but nothing below it - traced to a wrapper-only bug (not in the
real component): the real `App.tsx` only ever mounts `ProfileManagementView` after its own
app-wide `profiles` state is already loaded, but this PoC's thin `ProfileManagementPage` wrapper
was mounting it immediately with an empty array and filling `profiles` in after
`invoke('profiles_list')` resolved - and `ProfileManagementView`'s own `selectedId` state is
seeded from `profiles[0]` only once, at mount, so it never picked up the real data once it
arrived. Fixed by gating the mount on the fetch resolving first (`profile-management-entry.tsx`),
matching the real app's own mount order instead of working around the component. After the fix,
the re-screenshot shows the complete real form: the real dropdown, "Current install folder:
/tmp/poc-profile-dest-move" (the exact path the standalone `profiles.move` test above produced),
the copy/move radio buttons, and the destination/name fields - the real, unmodified component
rendering real data through both the sidecar RPC path and (indirectly, via the same `profiles`
state) the architecture the native-dialog command will feed into.

**The native dialog itself does not complete in this sandbox - and fails differently than
`shell.openPath` did.** Called `dialog_select_directory` directly (a minimal temporary test page,
same `tauri.conf.json`-`url` technique, invoking it on load and recording the result in the
window title) and waited 10+ seconds: the window title never changed - no result, no error.
Screenshotting mid-wait showed the main window's content had gone blank white (not just
unrepainted, as in "A rendering dead end" above - genuinely blank), and `xdotool search` found
two new, unnamed X windows appear alongside the main one that weren't there before the call. Read
together, this looks like `blocking_pick_folder()` genuinely attempting to create a native dialog
surface - unlike `shell.openPath`'s `gio open`, which failed fast and cleanly with no GUI session
at all - and then blocking indefinitely waiting for a human click that can never come
unattended, rather than erroring out. This is a sandbox-only gap, not a sign the plugin is wired
wrong (the call compiles, the command registers, and something real happens on calling it,
which is more than "nothing happens"); it just means this one piece - unlike every other native
call this PoC has made - needs a real desktop session with a human at the keyboard to confirm the
happy path, something to flag honestly rather than paper over with a synthetic "it returned
`null`" result this sandbox didn't actually produce.

This round's overall shape: a write path through the sidecar ports exactly like a read path did,
with one real scoping cut (schedule re-arming) worth remembering for a real migration; a
main-process-only concern (the native dialog) ports as a main-process-only Rust command, not a
sidecar call, because that's what the real app's own architecture already says to do; and a
wrapper-only ordering bug was caught and fixed specifically *because* this PoC insists on
screenshotting real data through the real component, rather than trusting it compiles correctly.

### The actual headline case: starting and stopping a real server process

Every proof so far has been about *reading* or *writing data* - profiles, logs, console output,
even the bot and web dashboard subsystems are ultimately about moving information around. None of
it has touched the one thing a "server manager" actually exists to do: start and stop a real
server process. `lib/serverProcess.ts` (980 lines - PID tracking, RCON-confirmed graceful
shutdown with a force-kill fallback, a staggered spawn queue, crash/adoption handling) had been
completely untouched until this round.

**`startServer()`/`stopServer()`/`getStatus()` are real, unmodified, and need no Electron shim at
all.** `startServer()` does a plain `child_process.spawn(getExecutablePath(profile),
buildLaunchArgs(profile), { cwd, detached, stdio: 'ignore' })` - no `app.*`/`shell.*` coupling
anywhere in this path, confirmed by the fact that porting it needed zero additions to
`electronShim.ts`. `getExecutablePath` is already platform-aware
(`def.executableWin`/`def.executableLinux` per game, from `shared/games.ts`) - on this Linux
sandbox it resolves to each game's real `executableLinux` path (e.g.
`ShooterGame/Binaries/Linux/ArkAscendedServer` under the profile's `installDir`), so there was no
Windows-only code path to work around for this proof. Two new sidecar RPC methods
(`server.start`/`server.stop`, taking a `profileId` and resolving the real profile the same way
`profiles.copy`/`.move` already do) and three matching `main.rs` commands
(`server_start`/`server_stop`/`server_status`) are the entire port - same thin-wrapper shape as
every other subsystem in this PoC.

**No real ARK/Minecraft dedicated server binary exists in this sandbox, so standalone/compiled-app
testing needed a stand-in - the same role `console.appendTestLine` already played for log output,
now for the process side.** A test-only third RPC method, `server.installTestExecutable`, writes
a tiny long-running shell script to the real, unmodified `getExecutablePath(profile)`'s resolved
path (`#!/bin/sh` + a `sleep`-forever loop, exiting cleanly on SIGTERM like a real game server
does). Nothing about `startServer()`/`stopServer()` themselves is faked or stubbed - only the
"game server" they spawn is synthetic, exactly the same honesty boundary the console-feed proof
already drew.

**Confirmed standalone, piping JSON-RPC lines directly into the SEA sidecar binary (one
continuous session, start through stop):** `server.start` really spawns the fake script as a real
OS process - `ps` showed the exact real command line `buildLaunchArgs()` produced
(`TheIsland_WP?listen?Port=7777?RCONEnabled=True?RCONPort=27020 -server -log
-ServerPlatform=PC -WinLiveMaxPlayers=70`) running under a genuine new PID. Two `server-status`
push events arrived unprompted (`starting` with no pid, then `starting` with the real pid) -
`emitStatus()`'s own two-stage shape, reached through this sidecar exactly like
`profiles-changed`/`manager-log-entry` were. `server.stop` ran the real shutdown sequence:
`sendRconCommand(profile, 'SaveWorld')` failed immediately (no `ServerAdminPassword` on this fake
profile, so `rcon.ts` never even opens a socket) and was then correctly skipped to the
grace-period wait rather than treated as license to send `DoExit` - `waitForExitOrKill` waited out
the full `graceMs`, sent one SIGTERM, and `getStatus()` afterward (checked both via the push event
and a fresh `server.status` call) correctly reported `stopped`, confirmed independently against
the real OS process list (the pid was genuinely gone, not just marked gone in the store).

**A real bug this found in testing, not in the port:** the stand-in script's first version
ignored SIGTERM entirely (to deliberately exercise the force-kill path, or so the thinking went).
That made `stopServer()` take the full `graceMs` *plus* `FORCE_KILL_CONFIRM_MS` (10 seconds,
hardcoded in `serverProcess.ts`) to resolve - because `waitForExitOrKill`'s "force kill" is
actually just **one** `child.kill()` call (SIGTERM, Node's default signal) followed by a poll with
a 10-second give-up, not an escalation to SIGKILL. If a real game server process ever truly
ignored SIGTERM, `stopServer()` would still resolve as `stopped` after that 10-second give-up -
`finalizeStopped`/`running.delete` run unconditionally once `giveUp` fires - while the actual OS
process kept running, orphaned, outside the Manager's tracking. Real ARK/Minecraft dedicated
servers do exit on SIGTERM (this is airplane-visible AAA-game-server behavior, not something that
needs re-confirming here), so this almost certainly never happens in practice - but it's a real
property of the unmodified shutdown code, found by testing with a deliberately misbehaving
stand-in, not a flaw introduced by this port. Fixed the stand-in to exit on SIGTERM (what a real
server actually does) for the rest of this round's testing, once the finding was noted.

**Confirmed through the real compiled app, not just standalone.** Ran the actual
`tauri_poc_shell` binary under Xvfb with a temporary, immediately-reverted `setTimeout` chain in
`index.html` driving Save → Install fake executable → Start → (2s later) Stop - the same
"temporary trigger, verified on disk, reverted before commit" technique established in "A real
rendering dead end," here checking the real OS process list instead of the filesystem.
`ps aux | grep ArkAscendedServer` showed nothing at t=3s (before Start), the real spawned process
(exact real command line) at t=5s, and nothing again at t=11s (after Stop's grace period and
SIGTERM) - end to end through the real webview → `invoke()` → Rust → sidecar → `startServer()`/
`stopServer()` round trip, not just the standalone sidecar test above.

**What this doesn't prove yet, beyond "no real game server binary":** the Windows-only
`.bat`-launch path for ARK: Survival Evolved (`launchViaBatch`, untested - this sandbox is Linux
and the test profile used `ark-ascended`, which never takes that branch), and no UI page calls
any of this yet (`Dashboard.tsx`, 758 lines, is where the real Start/Stop/Restart buttons live -
out of scope for this round, which proved the RPC layer first, the same order bot/web-dashboard
were proven in before any UI). `adoptPersistedProcesses`, the staggered spawn queue, and
`watchLogFileForMarker`'s "fully started" detection - all initially on this list too - are now
proven; see directly below and "A server that actually finishes starting" further down.

**The staggered multi-server spawn queue (`reserveSpawnSlot`), confirmed with two separate
profiles and zero code changes - this is existing, already-wired behavior, not a new port.**
Seeded two profiles with their own fake executables and called `server.start` on each back to
back (real `serverAutoStartStaggerSeconds` default: 10s, left unmodified rather than overridden
for a faster test). The first server's response carried a real pid immediately, same as every
single-server test above. The second's response, by contrast, had **no `pid` field at all** -
exactly `startServer()`'s `queuedStatus` shape (`{ profileId, state: 'starting', startedAt }`,
nothing else) - and only one `server-status` push event fired at request time instead of two,
confirming it took the queued branch, not the immediate-spawn one. A second push event for the
queued server then arrived on its own, unprompted, ~10 seconds later, this time carrying a real
pid - `doSpawn()` actually running via the `setTimeout` callback `startServer()`'s queuing branch
schedules. Checked against the real OS process list to rule out a fluke in the push-event timing
alone: `ps -eo pid,lstart` showed the first server's process started at `13:52:47` and the
second's at `13:52:57` - a genuine 10-second gap between two real OS-level spawns, driven by the
*first* server's own `startedAt` (the "global, not per-profile" queue the function's own comment
describes), not by when the second request happened to arrive.

### Surviving a crash: reattaching to a server the Manager lost track of

A running ARK/Minecraft server process is deliberately `detached`/`.unref()`'d from the Manager
in `startServer()` specifically so it survives the Manager itself crashing or being force-closed
- a real reliability promise of the app, not an incidental detail. `adoptPersistedProcesses()`
(`serverProcess.ts`) is the other half of that promise: on startup, the real app re-attaches to
any pid it finds still alive in the persisted store, so a relaunch doesn't "forget" about a
server that's still running and let a user accidentally start a second instance on the same
ports. This was flagged as unproven in every earlier round of this PoC - closing it here.

**Wired in exactly where the real app wires it, adapted for this architecture's equivalent of "app
startup."** The real `index.ts` calls `adoptPersistedProcesses(profiles, getRunningPids(),
getRunningStartedAt())` once, after registering its own status watchers and before anything else
touches server state. `sidecar.ts` now calls the same real, unmodified function the same way, at
sidecar module load - the right analog, since a new sidecar process only ever starts exactly when
the real app's main process would (a fresh launch, not a page reload or webview reconnect), so
"the Manager restarts" and "a new sidecar process starts" are the same event here.
`getRunningPids`/`getRunningStartedAt` are the real, already-imported-from-the-same-file
`store.ts` functions - no new real-code imports needed beyond `adoptPersistedProcesses` itself.

**Confirmed standalone: start a server, crash the sidecar (not a graceful stop), confirm the real
process survives, start a brand new sidecar, confirm it reports `running` with zero calls to
`server.start`.** Session A seeded a profile, installed the fake executable, and called
`server.start` (real pid, confirmed as before). Session A was then killed with `SIGKILL` - not
`server.stop`, an actual simulated crash - and the fake server process was confirmed still alive
on the real OS process list immediately after. A brand new sidecar process (session B) was then
started against the same persisted store: **before even printing its own "ready" line**, it
emitted a `server-status` push event showing `state: "running"` with the exact same real pid -
`adoptPersistedProcesses` running synchronously at module load, exactly mirroring the real app's
own startup-order comment. A plain `server.status` call confirmed the same thing on request.
Calling `server.stop` from session B then exercised the *other* real code path this proof reaches
that every earlier round hadn't: `waitForExitOrKill`'s "adopted process" branch (`entry.process
=== null`, since this sidecar never spawned it - it only inherited the pid), which polls
`isPidAlive`/calls `killByPid` instead of using `child.kill()`/a `child.once('exit', ...)`
listener. That path ran correctly too: the real OS process was confirmed gone afterward.
Reproduced identically against both the dev bundle (`node dist/sidecar.cjs`) and the real SEA
binary (`dist/sidecar-bin`) - not just one packaging mode.

**Confirmed through the real compiled app, not just standalone - a genuine "kill the whole app,
relaunch it" test, not a simulation of one.** Using the same temporary-`setTimeout`-trigger,
reverted-before-commit technique as the server start/stop proof above: app instance #1 (Save →
Install → Start) was launched under Xvfb, confirmed via the real process list to have spawned the
fake server, then killed outright with `SIGKILL` - not just the sidecar this time, the whole
`tauri_poc_shell` process tree, actually simulating a Manager crash rather than a graceful close.
The fake server process was confirmed still alive afterward (reparented to init, `ps` showing its
real ppid changed). A second, completely fresh app instance (#2) was then launched against the
same on-disk profile store, with a different temporary trigger (`server_status` then
`server_stop`) - by the time it was checked, the real OS process was gone, meaning the real
webview → `invoke('server_status')`/`invoke('server_stop')` → Rust → the brand-new sidecar's own
`adoptPersistedProcesses` → real `killByPid` chain all ran correctly, end to end, through two
genuinely separate app processes sharing only the same on-disk store - not two RPC calls against
one long-lived sidecar, which is what every other proof in this PoC so far has actually been
testing.

### A server that actually finishes starting

Every server-lifecycle proof so far left status stuck at `starting` forever, by design: the fake
stand-in executable never wrote anything resembling a real ARK engine log, so
`watchLogFileForMarker()` - the real function that watches for the exact line
(`"Server has completed startup and is now advertising for join"`) a real server writes once it's
actually done loading, and flips status to `running` - never had anything to find. That was
flagged honestly each time as a real gap, not quietly accepted as permanent: a real server
*does* write that line, so there was an honest way to simulate it after all, the same way
`console.appendTestLine` already simulates realistic log output elsewhere in this PoC.

**`server.installTestExecutable` gained an opt-in `withStartupMarker` flag** (plumbed through the
matching `server_install_test_executable` Tauri command too). When set, the generated stand-in
script does two additional things a real ARK server's own launch already does: creates its log
file immediately on startup (empty), then - a few seconds later, from a backgrounded subshell -
appends the real startup-complete line to it. `watchLogFileForMarker()`/`markReady()` themselves
are untouched; only the test fixture that feeds them changed.

**A real ordering bug was found and fixed in the test fixture itself, not in the port.** The
first version appended the marker line to the log file without creating it first.
`watchLogFile()`'s own polling logic treats its *first* successful read of a file as nothing more
than a size baseline (see its own comment on this) - never calling back with "new" content on
that first tick, by design, so a Manager restart doesn't treat a server's entire pre-existing log
as a flood of brand-new lines. That meant a marker line present the very first time the file was
ever seen got silently absorbed into that baseline and never reported as a chunk at all. A real
ARK server could never trigger this - its log exists and is already growing well before the
startup-complete line appears in it - so this was purely an artifact of the fake script creating
the file and writing the marker in the same instant. Fixed by having the script create the
(empty) log file immediately and append the marker only after a delay, matching a real server's
actual shape and giving `watchLogFile` an earlier, uneventful baseline tick to work from first.

**Confirmed standalone: the real `starting` → `running` transition, driven by the real marker
detection, not a timeout.** Seeded a profile, installed the fixture with the marker flag set, and
called `server.start`: the usual two `server-status` push events arrived immediately (`starting`,
then `starting` with a real pid), then a **third**, unprompted, about four seconds later -
`state: "running"`, same pid - `watchLogFileForMarker()` detecting the real log line
`watchLogFile`'s own 2-second poll tick picked up and calling the real `markReady()`. Confirmed
independently by reading the fake server's own log file afterward: it contained exactly the one
real startup-complete line the script wrote. `STARTUP_FALLBACK_MS` (`serverProcess.ts`'s own
safety net for a server that never logs a recognizable startup line - 5 minutes) was not
separately re-timed - 300 real seconds of idle waiting to confirm a plain `setTimeout` fires on
schedule wouldn't have told this PoC anything a close reading of the unmodified constant doesn't
already say with the same confidence.

**Confirmed through the real compiled app too**, using the same temporary-trigger-under-Xvfb
technique as every other server-lifecycle proof: `server_install_test_executable` was called with
the marker flag through the real webview → `invoke()` → Rust → sidecar chain, and the real fake
server's log file was confirmed, a few seconds after Start, to contain the real startup-complete
line - end to end through the actual compiled app, not just the standalone sidecar test above.

### A third real page, in a different subsystem: player management

Every page ported so far has been about profiles (read-only logs, then copy/move). Player
management is a genuinely different real domain - a live RCON-driven roster plus the Manager's
own persisted ban/whitelist records - backed by three separate real IPC modules
(`ipc/playerRoster.ts`/`playerBans.ts`/`playerWhitelist.ts`) this PoC had never touched.
`PlayerRosterPanel.tsx` (198 lines) was picked specifically because it mixes both shapes in one
page: `playerRoster.list`/`.kick` and `playerBans.ban` all gate on a real `sendRconCommand()` call
succeeding first, while `playerWhitelist.add` is tracking-only and never touches RCON at all (see
that file's own doc comment on why) - a real, fully successful write every time, next to three
real, honestly-RCON-gated ones.

**The port is the same thin-wrapper shape as every other subsystem in this PoC, applied to a
third real file.** Four new sidecar RPC methods (`playerRoster.list`/`.kick`,
`playerBans.ban`, `playerWhitelist.add`) each mirror their real `ipc/*.ts` handler's body exactly
- same real functions (`sendRconCommand`, `parsePlayerListWithIds`, `recordPlayerBan`,
`recordWhitelistedPlayer`, all imported unmodified), same order, same success/failure shape -
and four matching `main.rs` commands. `confirmAction()` (the real, unmodified
`lib/confirmAction.ts` every Kick/Ban/Whitelist-adjacent action in the real app calls before
acting) needed one more real native command: `window.api.system.focusWindow()`, backing the real
Electron/Windows focus-loss workaround (`lib/windowFocus.ts`'s `forceRefocus()`) - ported as
`window_focus`, a Rust-only command with no sidecar involvement (same architectural class as
`dialog_select_directory`: a window-handle operation, not business logic), replicating
`forceRefocus()`'s own real minimize-then-unminimize-then-focus sequence via Tauri's window API
rather than a no-op stub.

**Confirmed standalone: a real successful write, and two real, honest RCON failures - not three
stubs with different labels.** `playerWhitelist.add` against a seeded fake profile produced a
real `recordWhitelistedPlayer()` write, confirmed independently by reading the real
`config.json`'s own `playerWhitelist` array afterward (real `addedAt` timestamp, real
`profileIds`). A follow-up `playerWhitelist.list` call confirmed it persisted. `playerRoster.list`
against the same profile returned `[]` - not an error - exactly matching the real handler's own
`result.ok && result.response ? parsePlayerListWithIds(result.response) : []`: RCON genuinely
failed (no `ServerAdminPassword` on this fake profile, `rcon.ts` never opens a socket), and the
real handler's own graceful-degradation shape swallowed that into an empty roster rather than
throwing. `playerBans.ban` against the same profile, by contrast, *did* throw - its own real gate
requires the RCON call to succeed before it ever reaches `recordPlayerBan()` - producing the exact
same `"No ServerAdminPassword set in this server's GameUserSettings.ini"` message `stopServer()`'s
RCON `SaveWorld` attempt already surfaced in an earlier round. Three different real outcomes from
three real code paths, not one simulated behavior repeated three times.

**Confirmed through the real compiled app too, including a real limitation worth stating
honestly.** Seeded the same profile, pointed the main window at `player-roster.html` directly
(the same technique as the other two real-page proofs) and screenshotted under Xvfb: the real,
unmodified component rendered a real server card - "POC Test Server (0)" - "No players connected
right now.", the exact same graceful-empty-roster outcome the standalone test already produced,
now through the genuine webview → `invoke()` → Rust → sidecar chain. **The real Kick/Ban/Whitelist
buttons themselves were not reachable this way** - they only render inside a live roster row,
and a live roster row only exists when RCON actually returns connected players, which needs a
real ARK server this sandbox fundamentally cannot provide (the same category of gap as the native
folder picker's happy path). Rather than leave that corner unconfirmed, a temporary
invoke-directly trigger (same revert-before-commit discipline as every other temporary trigger in
this PoC) called `player_whitelist_add` straight through the real webview, bypassing the
unreachable UI row - and the real `config.json` gained the real new entry afterward, confirming
the Rust-level plumbing specifically (not just the sidecar logic the standalone test already
covered) reaches the real store write end to end.

### A fourth real page, and a correction to "A rendering dead end"

`PlayerWhitelistPanel.tsx` (179 lines) was picked specifically because it's the first page in
this PoC whose real write-path buttons are reachable with **no** RCON, no live server, nothing
this sandbox can't provide - `list`/`add`/`remove` are a plain centralized, tracking-only
electron-store CRUD (see that file's own doc comment on why it never touches RCON, unlike
`PlayerBansPanel.tsx`'s parallel page). That made it the first real opportunity all PoC to
actually test *clicking through the real rendered form itself*, rather than falling back to a
direct `invoke()` bypass the way every previous write-path proof in this PoC (including the one
immediately above) ultimately had to.

**`playerWhitelist.remove` (plus a `playerWhitelist.list` Tauri command the earlier round never
needed) is the only new real-code surface this page needed** - `list`/`add` were already proven
in "A third real page." `removeWhitelistedPlayerProfile()` is called exactly as the real handler
calls it. Standalone, a full real CRUD cycle (list → add → list confirms it → remove → list
confirms it's gone) ran cleanly against the SEA binary, no new ground beyond what the previous
round had already shown for `add`.

**A real correction to "A rendering dead end," found by accident while confirming this page's
write path.** A temporary script (revert-before-commit, as always) drove the real, unmodified
form through genuine DOM APIs: the native `HTMLInputElement` value setter + a dispatched `input`
event (the standard way to make a controlled React input see a programmatic value change), a real
`checkbox.click()`, and a real `button.click()` found by its exact text. The real `onClick`
handler fired, called the real `window.api.playerWhitelist.add` -> real `invoke()` -> Rust ->
sidecar -> `recordWhitelistedPlayer()` chain, and **the screen visibly updated to show it**: two
screenshots taken a second apart showed the same real post-add state - the form's inputs cleared,
the checkbox unchecked, and a real new row in the "Whitelisted (1)" table with the real entered
id/name and a real timestamp. That directly contradicts "A rendering dead end"'s own
conclusion - and that section had *already* ruled out input-simulation as the variable (its own
step 3 used a `setTimeout`-triggered save, not a simulated click, and still saw no repaint), so
"xdotool vs. a real DOM method" isn't a sufficient explanation either; this round's trigger used
the same `setTimeout` + same-origin JS approach that round already tried and found didn't help.
What's actually different between the two tests - this page vs. `index.html`, this round's exact
Xvfb invocation vs. that one's, or something else entirely - hasn't been isolated, and this
README won't guess at a root cause it didn't actually verify. What's now owed an honest update is
the conclusion itself: "WebKitGTK never repaints after the first frame in this sandbox" is **not
a safe assumption going forward** - it held for one specific test and was stated more broadly
than the evidence supported. Future rounds of this PoC should screenshot again after a write,
rather than assuming it is futile.

**Later update - the actual difference, found in "A fifth real page" (further down): this page's
write path never went through `listen()` at all.** `playerWhitelist.add`'s result reaches the
screen through the click handler's own `window.api.playerWhitelist.add(...)` → `invoke()` →
`.then(setState)` chain - an ordinary request/response round trip, same as any other button click
in this PoC. `index.html`'s `pushStatusEl` update in "A rendering dead end," by contrast, only
ever happens inside a `listen('profiles-changed', ...)` callback - a push event delivered
unprompted, outside any click. Those are genuinely different code paths, and only the second one
was broken: `src-tauri/capabilities/` didn't exist anywhere in this PoC until that round, so
every `event.listen()` call (and only `event.listen()` - plain `invoke()` calls were never
ACL-gated) was being silently rejected. This page's repaint always worked because it was never
exercising the broken path in the first place - not because WebKitGTK's repaint behavior was
inconsistent between the two tests. (One unrelated cosmetic wrinkle in this round's screenshot:
the new row's Name/Id cells rendered visually blank while `On`/`Since` didn't - likely a quirk in
this PoC's own hand-written approximate CSS for this one page, not a defect in the real
component, since the underlying data was independently confirmed correct via the real
`config.json` file regardless.)

### Measured, on this Linux sandbox

- Release binary (`src-tauri/target/release/tauri_poc_shell`): **11 MB**, vs. `node_modules/electron`'s 266 MB.
- Sidecar bundle (`sidecar/dist/sidecar.cjs`, includes `electron-store` and its deps): **392 KB**.
- Idle RSS: shell **~145 MB**, Node sidecar **~48 MB** (~193 MB combined), measured via
  WebKitGTK with software rendering (no GPU passthrough in this sandbox - `libEGL warning: DRI3
  error`). **Do not take this as the Windows number** - WebView2 on Windows shares the
  system Edge/Chromium runtime already installed on the machine rather than embedding its own
  copy the way Electron does, and runs with real GPU acceleration on real hardware; both cut
  against this measurement in opposite, hard-to-predict ways. The disk-size comparison above is
  solid regardless of platform; the RAM comparison needs a real Windows run to mean anything.

### Sidecar packaging (Node SEA)

The dev setup above (`SIDECAR_PATH` pointing at `dist/sidecar.cjs`, run via `node`) was always
flagged in this README as "not how a shipped build would locate it" - this is that gap closed,
at least on Linux. Node's own SEA (Single Executable Applications) feature, stable since Node
20 and confirmed present here on Node 22.22.0, bundles the Node runtime itself plus
`dist/sidecar.cjs` into one standalone executable:

```sh
node --experimental-sea-config sea-config.json   # writes dist/sea-prep.blob
cp "$(command -v node)" dist/sidecar-bin
npx postject dist/sidecar-bin NODE_SEA_BLOB dist/sea-prep.blob \
  --sentinel-fuse NODE_SEA_FUSE_fce680ab2cc467b6e072b8b5df1996b2
```
(scripted as `build-sea.mjs`, run after `build.mjs`).

**Confirmed working, not just built:** piping a raw JSON-RPC line into the resulting
`dist/sidecar-bin` directly (no `node` invocation) returned a correct `profiles.list` response.

**The honest tradeoff this surfaces:** `dist/sidecar-bin` is **~119 MB**, because it embeds a
full copy of the Node runtime (the `node` binary on this machine is ~123 MB; the SEA blob adds
~400 KB on top of that for the actual application code). That's not a packaging inefficiency to
fix later - it's the actual cost of "no `node` needed on the target machine," here or with any
other approach (a bundled portable Node runtime next to a plain `.cjs` would cost the same
~120 MB, just as two files instead of one). Combined with the 11 MB shell, that's **~130 MB**
total for this one sidecar - still well under Electron's 266 MB, but nowhere near the "11 MB
shell + 392 KB sidecar" numbers above might imply on their own if read without this section.
Two sidecars built this way (main process logic, bot - see "The Discord bot subsystem" below),
each embedding its own full Node copy, would start to erode the size advantage this whole
migration is supposed to deliver - worth weighing against a single shared sidecar process
serving both roles instead of one SEA binary per role. The web dashboard turned out not to add
a third: see "The web dashboard subsystem" below - it's an in-process `http.Server`, not a
separate process, so it rides along in the main sidecar's own SEA binary for free.

### Wired into Tauri's real `externalBin` mechanism, not just spawned by path

The SEA binary above was initially spawned with a hand-rolled `std::process::Command` pointed
at a source-tree path - functional, but explicitly flagged as not the real packaging mechanism.
That gap is now closed: `main.rs` spawns the sidecar through `tauri-plugin-shell`'s actual
sidecar API (`app.shell().sidecar("sidecar-bin")`, added as a dependency), and
`tauri.conf.json` declares `bundle.externalBin: ["binaries/sidecar-bin"]` - the real,
documented mechanism for shipping a non-Rust helper binary inside a Tauri app. `build-sea.mjs`
now also copies its output to `src-tauri/binaries/sidecar-bin-<target-triple>` (queried via
`rustc -vV`'s `host:` line), the exact filename convention Tauri's build script requires.

Rewriting the Rust side for this meant swapping the manual `Child`/`ChildStdin`/`BufReader`
plumbing for the plugin's own `Command`/`CommandChild`/`CommandEvent` types - a different API
shape (`CommandEvent::Stdout`/`Stderr`/`Error`/`Terminated` arrive over an async
`tauri::async_runtime::Receiver` instead of a blocking `BufReader::lines()` iterator on a
dedicated thread), but the same JSON-RPC protocol underneath, so `sidecar.ts` needed no changes
at all.

**Confirmed, not just compiled:** rebuilt and ran the app under Xvfb again with this change in
place. `pstree` showed the same result as before - `sidecar-bin` as a direct child of
`tauri_poc_shell`, no `node` anywhere - but this time resolved through the real `externalBin`
path instead of a hardcoded one. The read path was re-confirmed via the "Got 0 profile(s)..."
screenshot. The write + push path was re-confirmed the same way as the original write+push
verification: a temporary `setTimeout`-triggered save (reverted before committing, same
technique as the original "rendering dead end" investigation below), checked against the
on-disk store file - the full real `saveProfile()` migration/defaulting pipeline ran and wrote
correctly through this new transport, with no errors in the sidecar's inherited stderr.

**Still open:** `SIDECAR_PATH` dev iteration now goes through `app.shell().command("node")`
instead of a raw `Command::new("node")` - same idea, different API, not separately
stress-tested beyond compiling and being structurally identical to the `sidecar()` path above.
Code-signing and auto-update remain completely untouched. The actual bundling step
(`cargo tauri build`) is covered next - it found a real bug `cargo build` never could.

### Actually bundled and installed with `cargo tauri build` - and a real bug it found

Everything above was still `cargo build` + running the raw binary from `target/debug/` - never
the real packaging command, and never a real install. That gap is closed too: installed the
`tauri-cli` (`cargo install tauri-cli --version "^2.0.0"`), set `bundle.active: true` and
`bundle.targets: ["deb"]` in `tauri.conf.json` (plus `bundle.icon`, which Tauri's bundler
requires explicitly - the dev-mode `cargo build` path never asked for it), and ran
`cargo tauri build --bundles deb`.

**It worked, genuinely**: a 44.5 MiB `.deb` came out, and `dpkg --contents` confirms the sidecar
binary is really inside it as an ordinary installed file, not just referenced:

```
usr/bin/tauri_poc_shell      14.9 MB
usr/bin/sidecar-bin         123.9 MB   <- the SEA binary, renamed from sidecar-bin-<triple>
usr/share/applications/tauri-poc-shell.desktop
usr/share/icons/hicolor/256x256/apps/tauri_poc_shell.png
```

Installed it for real with `dpkg -i` (not just unpacked - a real `apt`/`dpkg` install,
registered in the package database) and ran `/usr/bin/tauri_poc_shell` directly, from `/tmp`,
with none of this PoC's source tree on the path anywhere.

**It crashed on first launch.** Not a cosmetic issue - the sidecar died immediately:

```
Error: Project name could not be inferred. Please specify the `projectName` option.
    at new Conf (dist/sidecar.cjs:10010:19)
    at new ElectronStore (dist/sidecar.cjs:10437:9)
```

This is exactly the kind of thing this whole PoC methodology exists to catch: every earlier
check in this README ran the sidecar from inside the source checkout, where `conf` (the package
behind `electron-store`) could silently find *some* `package.json` nearby and infer a project
name from it when its own Electron-detection failed over to that fallback - the "harmless for
this PoC" wrinkle already documented under "Findings" below. Once genuinely installed to
`/usr/bin`, with no `package.json` anywhere nearby, that fallback has nothing to find and
throws instead of silently working. The gap between "runs from a checkout" and "runs once
installed" was real, and only running the actual installed binary surfaced it.

**Root cause, traced into `electron-store`'s own source** (`node_modules/electron-store/index.js`):
its constructor only uses `app.getPath('userData')` as the data directory when **both**
`ipcMain` and `app` are truthy (`else if (ipcMain && app) { defaultCwd = app.getPath('userData') }`) -
otherwise `cwd` is left `undefined` and `conf` falls through to its own broken inference.
`electronShim.ts` only ever exported `app`, never `ipcMain`, so that branch was always being
skipped - the shim's `getPath('userData')` value was being computed correctly and then never
used, every single time, including in every earlier check in this README that happened to still
work.

**Fixed entirely inside `electronShim.ts` - no change to the real `store.ts` needed**: added a
minimal `ipcMain` stub (just a no-op `.on()`, enough to satisfy `electron-store`'s own internal
`ipcMain.on('electron-store-get-data', ...)` registration) and an `app.getVersion()` stub
(also called in that same code path). That's the one-line condition electron-store actually
checks - once `ipcMain` exists, it takes the `app.getPath('userData')` branch as intended, and
the separately-documented "electron-store's own fallback" wrinkle is now also fully resolved as
a side effect, not just "harmless."

**Confirmed, not just patched**: rebuilt, reinstalled the `.deb` (`dpkg -i` over the broken one),
and reran `/usr/bin/tauri_poc_shell` from `/tmp` again. Clean `sidecar: ready`, no errors. Both
the read path (screenshot, `Got 0 profile(s)...`) and the write + full migration pipeline
(temporary `setTimeout` trigger, reverted before committing, checked against
`~/.tauri-poc-bober-manager/config.json`) were re-verified against the actually-installed
binary, not the dev build.

### A fifth real page: wiring the real Start/Stop/Restart/Kill/Update buttons

"The actual headline case" above proved `startServer()`/`stopServer()`/`getStatus()` at the RPC
layer but left a gap open on purpose: "no UI page calls any of this yet." This round closes it -
`Dashboard.tsx` (`src/renderer/src/pages/`, 758 lines), completely unmodified, is now mounted for
real and its Start/Stop/Restart/Kill/Update buttons drive a real OS process through a click, not
through the RPC layer directly.

**The orchestration layer underneath is a different, more complete real file than the one "The
actual headline case" called directly.** The real desktop IPC handler
(`ipc/serverProcess.ts`) doesn't call `serverProcess.ts`'s `startServer()`/`stopServer()`
directly either - it goes through `lib/serverActions.ts`'s `doStartServer`/`doStopServer`/
`doRestartServer`/`doKillServer`/`doUpdateServer`, which wrap those calls with the CPU/RAM/
player-list monitor (`lib/monitor.ts`), crash-watch cancellation (`lib/crashWatch.ts`), and a
Manager activity-log entry for every action. None of that was exercised by the earlier round at
all - `sidecar.ts`'s `server.start`/`server.stop` now call `doStartServer`/`doStopServer`
instead, and gained `server.restart`/`server.kill`/`server.update` alongside them, all real,
unmodified functions, mirroring the exact call chain the real `ipc/serverProcess.ts` handler
uses. `doUpdateServer` calls the real SteamCMD `updateServer()`, which fails fast and honestly
("Set the SteamCMD path in Settings before updating.") with no real SteamCMD in this sandbox -
the same category of honestly-gated path as the RCON-dependent player-management calls.

**Confirmed standalone first, including a real subsystem this PoC had never touched: the CPU/RAM
monitor.** Piped JSON-RPC directly into the SEA binary: `server.start` on a stand-in executable
with the real startup-complete marker (same fixture as "A server that actually finishes
starting") produced the real `starting` → `running` transition, and ~5 seconds later - the
monitor's own 5-second self-rescheduling tick - a real `server-status` push arrived with
`cpu`/`memoryMB`/`memoryPercent` populated from a genuine `pidusage` read of the spawned PID, and
`players: []` from `listPlayers()`'s real RCON-failure fallback (no RCON server exists here
either). `server.restart`/`server.kill` were confirmed the same way, including a correctly
guarded `server.update` rejection ("Stop the server before updating it." while running, the real
SteamCMD-path error once stopped).

**`Dashboard.tsx` itself takes `profiles`/`statuses`/`maps`/`staticInfo`/`installedById`/
`gameVersionById`/`refreshInstalled` as plain props** - `App.tsx` owns and lifts all of that so
it survives Dashboard's own unmount/remount on every server-detail visit (see its own doc
comments). `dashboard-entry.tsx`'s wrapper stands in for that slice of `App.tsx` specifically:
`installedById`/`gameVersionById`/`refreshInstalled` are left empty/no-op (they only affect the
Update button's label and a version string, not the actual action), and the "+ Add Profile"
wizard stays out of scope (same native-folder-picker gap as "A second real page"). `maps` is a
one-entry stand-in, not real `maps.json` data. `staticInfo` and `HardwareStatsBar`'s network
figures are real, though - pulled through two new commands (`system_stats_get_static_info`/
`system_stats_get_network_usage`) backing the real, previously-untouched `lib/systemStats.ts`
(a fourth subsystem from the original Electron-coupling survey below, confirmed sidecar-portable
like the other three).

**esbuild has no default loader for the binary assets this page is the first to import.**
`Dashboard.tsx`/`HardwareStatsBar.tsx`/`lib/gameIcons.ts` import `.png` icons directly - no
earlier page in this PoC did - and a plain `esbuild` build failed outright with `No loader is
configured for ".png" files`, something the real app's own Vite build handles transparently.
Fixed in `build-react.mjs` with `loader: { '.png': 'dataurl' }`, inlining each icon as a base64
data URI in the page's own bundled `.js` rather than introducing a second kind of build output
(loose files) for one page.

**A real gap found and fixed in the wrapper, not the real code: `useServerStatuses`.** A first
version of `dashboard-entry.tsx` hand-rolled its own `statuses` state from nothing but the
`server-status` push listener - and a server adopted from a still-alive previous run (see
"Surviving a crash") showed as permanently "stopped" even though the real process was running.
Root cause: `adoptPersistedProcesses()` emits its one-time `running` status at sidecar startup,
well before the webview has finished loading and attached any listener - a push with no replay,
missed by construction. The real `App.tsx` doesn't have this bug because it never relies on the
push alone: `lib/useServerStatuses.ts` (32 lines) also pulls `window.api.server.status(id)` once
per profile on mount. Swapping in that real, unmodified hook (adding `server.status`/
`onStatusChanged` to the `window.api` shim) fixed it - confirmed by killing just the Tauri app
process (not the server, which survives detached - see "Surviving a crash"), relaunching, and
screenshotting a freshly-opened window that correctly showed "running" with the real uptime
immediately, no push required.

**Confirmed end to end through the real compiled app: a real click spawns and kills a real OS
process.** Seeded a profile and the real stand-in executable (with a startup marker) into the
same `~/.tauri-poc-bober-manager/config.json` this PoC's own standalone sidecar tests and the
real packaged app both read (same data directory, same file - `electronShim.ts`'s
`POC_USER_DATA`), then launched the real compiled app under Xvfb with a temporary auto-click
script (reverted before committing - see "A rendering dead end" below for why a real
`element.click()`, not `xdotool`, is this PoC's established technique). The real Start button's
`onClick` → `window.api.server.start` → `invoke('server_start')` → the real `doStartServer` chain
produced a real OS process, confirmed via the actual process list (`ps aux`), with the card
correctly showing `running`, the real uptime, and real `cpu`/`memoryMB` figures a few seconds
later via the monitor's own push. The real Stop button, clicked on a separately re-launched app
instance that re-adopted the still-running process, correctly showed `stopping` immediately and
then `stopped` ~15 seconds later (the real `stopServer()` default `graceMs`, with no RCON to
respond to `SaveWorld`/`DoExit`) - confirmed by the process actually disappearing from `ps aux`
at that point, not just the badge changing.

**Found and fixed a gap in the PoC's own Tauri setup, not in the real app: no `capabilities/*.json`
file existed anywhere in `src-tauri/`, at all, until this round.** Debugging why the real Stop
button's `server-status` push (see above) never visibly updated the UI - initially suspected to
be the same WebKitGTK repaint question as "A rendering dead end" below - a bare
`window.__TAURI__.event.listen(...)` call, written directly into `dashboard.html` with its
promise's resolution/rejection made visible in a plain `<div>` (bypassing React entirely, to rule
out a repaint problem specifically), came back **rejected**: `event.listen not allowed.
Permissions associated with this command: core:event:allow-listen, core:event:default`. Tauri 2's
permission system denies every core-plugin-exposed JS API - `event.listen` among them - unless a
capability file explicitly grants it; this PoC had never created one. Custom `#[tauri::command]`
functions (every `invoke(...)` call this whole PoC has made) are **not** ACL-gated the same way,
which is exactly why none of them ever surfaced this: `profiles_list`, `server_start`, all of it,
worked from the very first round regardless. `listen()` is the one JS-visible API this PoC uses
that goes through a plugin, not a custom command - and it was being silently rejected the entire
time. Fixed with one new file, `src-tauri/capabilities/default.json`, granting `core:default`/
`core:event:default`/`core:window:default` to the `main` window. Confirmed the fix is real, not
just locally plausible, by re-running the *exact* scenario "A rendering dead end" originally
documented as unrepaintable - `index.html`'s own `listen('profiles-changed', ...)` handler,
triggered by a real click on "Save a test profile" - and this time the page visibly updated live:
"Live update received via 'profiles-changed' push event (2 profile(s)) - not from a button
click." See the correction note added to that section below; this explains the original finding
far better than a WebKitGTK compositing limit does.

**Two follow-ups, confirmed in a later session.** First, the live console feed
(`listen('console-line', ...)`) had only ever been confirmed standalone (see "The live console
feed" above) - re-tested through the real webview now that the capabilities fix is in place
(start watching, wait a poll tick, simulate a line), and it updates live on screen too, closing
the one push-event type in this PoC that was still only standalone-confirmed. Second, the two
pieces of `Dashboard.tsx`'s own UI this round deliberately left unclicked that don't actually
need a native dialog - the card menu's Group submenu and a group's own bulk Start/Stop buttons -
got the same real-click treatment: `setProfileGroup` (a real `profiles.save` write) moved the
real seeded profile into the already-registered "PoC Group" through the real dropdown, and that
group's `startAll`/`stopAll` (the same `window.api.server.*` calls the single-card buttons use,
mapped over the group's members) spawned and killed the real OS process exactly like the
single-card round did - confirmed the same way, `ps aux` and the status badge agreeing. One
practical lesson from building the test script itself: `document.querySelector('.server-card-v2')`
picks whichever profile happens to render first, not a chosen one - worth remembering for any
later round that scripts a click against "the" card rather than a specifically identified one.

**A third follow-up, in the same later session: drag-to-reorder.** Seeded a second ungrouped test
profile (the existing two were down to one ungrouped card each, after the group-assignment
follow-up above, and reordering a one-item list proves nothing) and dispatched real
`DragEvent('dragstart')`/`DragEvent('dragover')`/`DragEvent('drop')` directly on the two card DOM
nodes - a `DataTransfer` object is required to even construct a `DragEvent`, but
`Dashboard.tsx`'s own handlers never read it, only a `dragId` kept in component state via
`onDragStart`, so this needed no special handling. The real `onDrop` → `handleDrop` →
`window.api.profiles.reorder` → `invoke('profiles_reorder')` → the real `setProfileOrder()`/
`reorderProfiles()` chain fired correctly: the two cards visibly swapped on screen, and -
checked independently, not just trusted from the screenshot - `config.json` on disk shows the
same swapped order afterward. This was the last piece of `Dashboard.tsx`'s own UI flagged as
unattempted; see the updated "What this doesn't prove yet" entry above for what's left in this
PoC overall (two items now, both needing a real desktop session/Windows machine this sandbox
can't provide, not further sandboxed testing).

### A sixth real page, and a PoC-wide bug in how errors cross the Tauri bridge

`AnalyticsTab.tsx` (`src/renderer/src/pages/ServerDetail/`, 321 lines) was picked specifically
because it pulls together five real subsystems in one page, none of them touched by this PoC
before: `lib/statsHistory.ts` (the **read** side of the CPU/RAM/player history `monitor.ts`'s
`recordStatSample` already writes - see "A fifth real page" above - proving the write-then-read
round trip, not just the write), `lib/schedule.ts`'s `getBackupScheduleStatus` (the Backup
Status panel), `lib/steamcmd.ts`'s `getInstalledBuildId` and `lib/serverVersion.ts`'s
`getGameVersion` (mirroring the real `ipc/serverProcess.ts` handlers' own cache-then-live-read
order exactly), `lib/updateCheck.ts`'s `getLatestBuildIdCache` (a pure cache read backing the
nested `UpdateCheckPanel` component), and three more `lib/systemFolders.ts` functions (the same
`shell.openPath` round trip `openProfilesFolder` already proved, three more real call sites of
it). None of them are Electron-coupled.

**Confirmed standalone first, including a genuine write-then-read round trip.** Piped JSON-RPC
into the SEA binary: enabled `statsEnabled` on a seeded profile, started the real stand-in
executable, and after the monitor's own 5-second tick, `statsHistory.get` returned the exact
real samples `recordStatSample` had just written - `cpu`/`memoryMB`/`players`, real timestamps,
nothing synthesized for the read side.

**Found and fixed a real wiring gap doing the same for `backup.getScheduleStatus`: it reported
`{ active: false }` even with a running server and a real cron schedule saved.** Unlike every
other push source in this PoC, `lib/schedule.ts`'s own `serverEvents.on('status', ...)`
subscription is **not** a module-load side effect - it only happens once
`registerBackupScheduleWatcher()` is actually called, the same real `index.ts` startup-order
requirement `adoptPersistedProcesses()` already has. Importing `getBackupScheduleStatus` alone
left nothing ever subscribed to real status transitions. Fixed by calling
`registerBackupScheduleWatcher()` once at sidecar startup (same place as
`adoptPersistedProcesses()`), and by adding `applyBackupSchedule(profile)` to `sidecar.ts`'s
`profiles.save` - the real `ipc/profiles.ts` handler calls it too, and this PoC's own
`profiles.save` had never needed it before now. Re-confirmed standalone: with both fixes,
`backup.getScheduleStatus` correctly reports `{ active: true, nextRunAt: <real cron next-fire
time> }` once the server transitions to `running`.

**Confirmed through the real compiled app**, pointing the main window at a new `analytics.html`
(same temporary-`tauri.conf.json`-`url` technique as every other page): the real form rendered
with real data throughout - the real CPU model/RAM figures carried over from `systemStats.ts`,
the real two recorded stats samples, "Enable stats" genuinely checked (the real
`profile.statsEnabled`), and `UpdateCheckPanel`'s own honest `"Checking..."` state (correctly
stuck there forever in this sandbox, since nothing here ever arms the real background SteamCMD
poller that would populate `getLatestBuildIdCache` - the same category of honestly-unconfirmable
gap as the native dialog's happy path, not a bug).

**The actual headline finding of this round: Tauri's `invoke()` does not reject with an
`Error`.** Clicking the real "INI Config" file-shortcut button (no real config folder exists for
this test profile) correctly reached the real, unmodified `openServerConfigFolder()` and
correctly rejected with its real message - confirmed directly against
`window.__TAURI__.core.invoke()`, bypassing React entirely, specifically to rule out a repaint
question first (see "A rendering dead end"/"A fifth real page" above for why that was the first
suspect). But the real component's own `{configFolderError && <p className="error-message">
{configFolderError}</p>}` display never appeared on screen. Traced to the exact type: Tauri's
`invoke()` rejects a Rust `Err(String)` with the **bare string itself**, not an `Error` instance
- confirmed with `typeof err === 'string'`, `err instanceof Error === false`,
`err.message === undefined`. Every real component in this app was written against Electron's
`ipcRenderer.invoke()` convention instead, where a rejection **is** a real `Error` - the
universal `catch (err) { setX((err as Error).message) }` pattern used across the whole real
renderer (this exact page's `configFolderError`, `Dashboard.tsx`'s `actionErrors`,
`ProfileManagementView`'s import error, ...) silently reads `undefined` on a Tauri rejection
instead of throwing or warning. No earlier round had actually clicked a real button through to a
real failure and checked the screen for the error text - every earlier error path was either
confirmed at the raw RPC/`invoke()` level only, or happened to be a success path on screen.

**Fixed once, centrally, not by touching the real components.** Added
`frontend/lib/tauriInvoke.ts`, a five-line `wrapInvoke()` that catches a non-`Error` rejection
and re-throws a real `Error` with the same message - applied to **every** entry file in this
PoC (`const invoke = wrapInvoke(window.__TAURI__.core.invoke)` in place of the old
`const { invoke } = window.__TAURI__.core`), not just this round's new one, since the gap was
always there in all five earlier pages' shims, just never exercised. Re-confirmed through the
real app: the same "INI Config" click now shows the real error text, in red, exactly where the
unmodified component puts it. A real migration would make this same fix once, at the transport
layer `invoke` is imported from, rather than touching every individual `catch` block in the real
renderer - which is exactly what this fix does.

### A seventh real page: world/player backups, the heaviest write path yet

`BackupsTab.tsx` (`src/renderer/src/pages/ServerDetail/`, 342 lines) was picked because it's the
heaviest real write path this PoC has ported: `createBackup()` really sends an RCON `SaveWorld`
when the server is running, waits a real 40-second settle, then zips real files off disk with
`archiver`; `restoreBackup()` really extracts a real zip straight over `SavedArks` with
`adm-zip`. It also mounts two more real, unmodified child components itself -
`PlayerBackupsSection.tsx` and `BackupLogPanel.tsx` - neither needed its own entry file, both
just call the same `window.api.backup`/`window.api.playerBackup` methods `BackupsTab` already
calls. Nine new sidecar RPC methods (`backup.create`/`.list`/`.delete`/`.restore`/`.openFolder`/
`.getLog`, `playerBackup.listFolders`/`.list`/`.openFolder`) each mirror their real
`ipc/backup.ts`/`ipc/playerBackup.ts` handler's body exactly - same real `lib/backup.ts`/
`lib/playerBackup.ts` functions, same `requireProfile`-then-call shape - plus two more push
events (`backup-created`/`backup-log-entry`, wrapping `lib/backup.ts`'s own `backupEvents`
`EventEmitter`, the same module-level-subscription shape as `profileEvents`/`managerLogEvents`/
`serverEvents` - no explicit "arm" call needed here, unlike `lib/schedule.ts`'s own subscription).

**Confirmed standalone first, a full real write cycle - not a single call in isolation.** Piped
JSON-RPC straight into the SEA binary against a seeded profile pointed at a real `SavedArks`
fixture (server stopped, so no RCON needed): `backup.create` produced a real `.zip`, with real
`backup-created`/`backup-log-entry` push events and a real `lib/managerLog.ts` entry alongside it
- all from the real, unmodified `createBackup()`, not a stand-in. `backup.list` read it back.
Deleted the save file from disk, called `backup.restore` with the just-created backup's path, and
the real file was back - a genuine round trip, confirmed by checking the filesystem directly, not
just trusting the RPC said "ok". `playerBackup.listFolders`/`.list`/`.openFolder` were confirmed
the same way against a fabricated player-backup folder (no real RCON player-connect event exists
in this sandbox to drive `backupPlayerProfile()` itself - same category of gap as every other
RCON-gated path in this PoC).

**Found and fixed a response-shape bug identical in kind to `log.record`'s own, found by actually
driving the RPC round trip rather than reading the handler's source.** `backup.delete`/
`backup.restore`'s sidecar methods originally just called `deleteBackup()`/`restoreBackup()`
directly and returned whatever they resolved to - `void`, same as the real functions. A real
`backup.restore` call genuinely put the deleted file back on disk (confirmed on the filesystem),
but the RPC response line itself read `{"id":6}` - no `result`, no `error` - which
`SidecarHandle::call` on the Rust side treats as `Err("sidecar returned neither a result nor an
error")` unconditionally, regardless of whether the real operation actually succeeded. Fixed the
same way `log.record` already was: both methods now return `{ ok: true }` explicitly after
calling the real (still unmodified) function.

**Confirmed through the real compiled app, including the full click-through cycle, not just a
read.** Seeded a profile with a real backup already on disk (so the initial screenshot shows real
data, not an empty state), pointed the main window at a new `backups.html`
(`?profile=poc-test-server`, same temporary-`tauri.conf.json`-`url` technique as every other
page) and screenshotted under Xvfb: the real, unmodified form rendered the real backup settings
(backup directory, max backups, the cron schedule from "A sixth real page"), the real world-backup
table (one real `.zip`, real size, real creation time), the real Player Profile Backups section
(a real player folder picked from a dropdown, a real per-player backup listed), and the real
Backup Process Log panel correctly showing "No backup activity yet" (an honest result, not a bug -
`getBackupLog`'s in-memory log is per-sidecar-process, as the panel's own real copy says, and this
was a fresh process from an earlier standalone run that wrote the on-disk data). A real click on
"Create backup now" then produced, live on screen: a new row at the top of the world-backup table
(the real `backup-created` push event driving `BackupsTab`'s own `onCreated` reload, not a manual
refresh) and a real log line in the Backup Process Log panel (the real `backup-log-entry` push
event reaching `BackupLogPanel`'s own `onLogChanged` handler) - both push-driven UI updates firing
correctly in the real running app, not just confirmed standalone. A further real click sequence -
select the new row's checkbox, click "Delete selected backup" - removed it from both the real
table on screen and the real file on disk, the table correctly settling back to showing just the
original backup. Not separately exercised through the real UI: the `canRestore` gate's disabled
state while a server is running (the underlying `restoreBackup()` guard - `isRunning(profile.id)`
throwing "Stop the server before restoring a backup." - is the same real code path `stopServer()`
itself already relies on elsewhere in this PoC, not new, untested logic), and the native "Browse…"
folder picker (same category of gap as "A second real page"'s own dialog happy path).

### An eighth real page, and a PoC-wide bug in how a legitimate `null` crosses the Tauri bridge

`UpdateLogTab.tsx` (`src/renderer/src/pages/ServerDetail/`, 52 lines) is the smallest page this
PoC has ported, and was picked specifically because its real contract includes a legitimate
`null`: `readUpdateLog(profileId): string | null` from `lib/steamcmd.ts` - real, unmodified,
backing `window.api.steamcmd.getUpdateLog`/`.onUpdateLogChanged` - returns `null` for any
profile that's never been updated, which `updateServer()` (already called by this PoC's
`server.update`) can never leave this sandbox in any other state, since it fails fast with "Set
the SteamCMD path in Settings before updating." before ever writing a log file (no real SteamCMD
install here). Wired one new RPC method (`steamcmd.getUpdateLog`) and one more independent push
source (`lib/steamcmd.ts`'s own `steamcmdUpdateEvents`, same module-level-subscription shape as
every push source except `lib/schedule.ts`'s), plus a test-only `steamcmd.appendTestUpdateLogLine`
(writes straight to the real log path and emits the real event) standing in for a real update run,
the same honest-simulation role `console.appendTestLine`/`server.installTestExecutable` already
play elsewhere in this PoC.

**The actual headline finding of this round: a legitimate JSON `null` result is indistinguishable,
on the Rust side, from the sidecar having sent no result at all.** `RpcResponse`'s
`#[serde(default)] result: Option<Value>` field - written for the bug class "A JSON-RPC response
needs a concrete, non-`undefined` result" already names (see `log.record`'s and
`backup.delete`/`backup.restore`'s own fixes) - turns out to have the opposite gap too: serde's
derived `Option<T>` deserializer treats a JSON `null` value the **same as the field being
absent**, both collapsing to `None`. Confirmed directly, not assumed from docs: deserializing
`{"id":1,"result":null}` and `{"id":2}` through the exact same derived struct produced identical
`result: None, error: None` output for both. `SidecarHandle::call`'s own match arm -
`(None, None) => Err("sidecar returned neither a result nor an error")` - then treats a real,
honest `readUpdateLog` → `null` exactly like a sidecar bug, rejecting the `invoke()` promise with
an opaque error instead of resolving it with `null`. Since `UpdateLogTab.tsx`'s own
`.then((log) => setLogContent(log ?? '...'))` chain has no `.catch()` (same as every other real
component in this PoC, none of which were written expecting a rejection on a normal, successful
read), the real effect would have been silent: the log panel stuck at its initial empty string,
on every single profile that's never been updated - the common case, not an edge case.

**Fixed with a custom `Deserialize` impl for `RpcResponse`, not a sidecar-side workaround.**
Wrapping every legitimately-`null`-returning sidecar method's result (the way `backup.delete`
wraps `void` in `{ ok: true }`) would work too, but only for methods whose authors remember to -
exactly the kind of per-call-site discipline this PoC's own fixes have otherwise tried to avoid
needing. The real fix belongs at the transport layer: `RpcResponse` now deserializes the whole
line into a `serde_json::Map` first and reads `result`/`error` via `.get()`, which (confirmed by
the same direct test) correctly returns `Some(&Value::Null)` for a present-but-null key and `None`
only when the key is genuinely absent - the distinction the derived `Option<Value>` field could
never make. `SidecarHandle::call`'s own match logic needed no change at all once that distinction
reached it correctly.

**Confirmed through the real compiled app, both the fix and the honest `null` case itself.**
Pointed the main window at a profile that has never been updated (`update-log.html?profile=...`,
same temporary-`tauri.conf.json`-`url` technique as every other page) and screenshotted under
Xvfb: the real, unmodified component correctly rendered "No update log yet - run Update at least
once." - not stuck empty, not an unhandled-rejection console error - confirming the fix handles
the honest `null` path, not just the already-has-data path. Re-pointed at `poc-test-server` (which
already had two real lines on disk from an earlier standalone round) and the real content rendered
too. A temporary trigger button (revert-before-commit, as always) calling
`steamcmd_append_test_update_log_line` twice, clicked through the real running app, produced two
real new lines appearing live on screen between clicks - the real `steamcmd-update-log-changed`
push event reaching the real, unmodified `onUpdateLogChanged` handler, confirmed the same way
every other live-push page in this PoC has been.

## Findings from actually running this, not from reading docs

- **Tauri event names reject dots.** `app.emit("profiles.changed", ...)` fails at runtime with
  `only alphanumeric, '-', '/', ':', '_' permitted for event names` - caught immediately
  because the whole call is wrapped and logged rather than ignored (see `main.rs`). Renamed to
  `profiles-changed`. A real migration would need this as a known constraint when choosing
  event names for every IPC channel being ported, not just this one.
- **~~`electron-store`'s own "am I really in Electron" check ignores a stubbed `app.getPath`~~ -
  root-caused and fixed, not just worked around.** The first write landed at
  `~/.config/ark-server-manager-nodejs/config.json` - not `electronShim.ts`'s intended
  `~/.tauri-poc-bober-manager`. Originally documented as "harmless for this PoC" (the data still
  round-tripped, just to the wrong directory) - that assessment didn't survive contact with a
  real install: see "Actually bundled and installed with `cargo tauri build`" above, where the
  exact same root cause crashed the sidecar outright once there was no `package.json` nearby for
  `conf`'s fallback to find. Traced into `electron-store`'s actual source
  (`node_modules/electron-store/index.js`): it only uses `app.getPath('userData')` when
  **both** `ipcMain` and `app` are truthy, and `electronShim.ts` only ever exported `app`.
  Fixed with a minimal `ipcMain` stub in the shim itself - zero changes to the real `store.ts`.
  Worth contrasting with `lib/managerLog.ts`'s own `getDataDir()` → `app.getPath('documents')`
  call, which *did* go through the shim correctly from the start (confirmed: a real `log.record`
  call landed at `~/Documents/ARK Server Manager/logs/manager.jsonl`, exactly where
  `electronShim.ts` says it should) - this quirk was specific to `electron-store`'s own
  Electron-detection logic, not a general problem with stubbing `app.getPath`.
- **A JSON-RPC response needs a concrete, non-`undefined` result.** `log.record`'s handler
  originally returned whatever `logManagerEvent(...)` resolves to, which is `void` -
  `JSON.stringify({ id, result: undefined })` silently drops the `result` key entirely, leaving
  a response line with neither `result` nor `error`, which Rust's `RpcResponse` (at the time,
  no `#[serde(default)]` on either field) would fail to deserialize. Fixed two ways: the
  handler now returns `{ ok: true }` instead of the bare promise result, and `RpcResponse`'s
  fields got `#[serde(default)]` as a second line of defense for any future handler that makes
  the same mistake.
- **esbuild doesn't resolve the project's own `@shared/*` tsconfig path alias on its own.**
  Bundling `serverProcess.ts`/`logEvents.ts` (needed for the console feed) failed outright -
  `Could not resolve "@shared/types"`/`"@shared/games"` - the instant they were imported,
  because esbuild has no built-in tsconfig-paths support; it needs to be told explicitly. Fixed
  by pointing esbuild's own `tsconfig` option at the project's real `tsconfig.node.json`
  (reusing the existing mapping as the source of truth) rather than hand-declaring
  `@shared/*` → `shared/*` a second time in `build.mjs`, which could drift from the real one. A
  real migration bundling more of `src/main/lib/` would hit this on the first file that uses
  the alias, not something specific to these two files.
- **esbuild has no default loader for binary assets either - same root cause as the alias issue
  above, different file type.** `Dashboard.tsx`'s own `.png` icon imports (the first page in this
  PoC to import one) failed outright with `No loader is configured for ".png" files`, since
  esbuild, unlike the real app's Vite build, doesn't infer one. Fixed with
  `loader: { '.png': 'dataurl' }` in `build-react.mjs`. See "A fifth real page" above.
- **Tauri 2's permission system silently blocks `event.listen()` with no `capabilities/*.json`
  file at all - and this PoC had never created one, in any round.** Every `invoke('custom_command')`
  call worked regardless (app-defined commands aren't ACL-gated), which is exactly why this went
  unnoticed for five rounds: nothing ever surfaced an error, the push events just never arrived.
  Mistaken at first for a WebKitGTK rendering limitation (see "A rendering dead end"'s original
  write-up) until a bare `listen()` call's own rejected promise was actually inspected. Fixed with
  one `capabilities/default.json` file granting `core:default`/`core:event:default`/
  `core:window:default` to the main window. See "A fifth real page" above for the full
  investigation and the retroactive re-confirmation against the original failing scenario.
- **Unlike `lib/*.ts`'s other `serverEvents.on(...)` subscribers, `lib/schedule.ts`'s is gated
  behind a function call, not a module-load side effect - importing just the status-reading
  function left it silently never subscribed.** `registerBackupScheduleWatcher()` has to be
  called once, same as `adoptPersistedProcesses()`. See "A sixth real page" above.
- **Tauri's `invoke()` rejects a failed command with the bare value the Rust side returned (a
  plain string here), not an `Error` instance - unlike Electron's `ipcRenderer.invoke()`, which
  every real component in this app was written against.** The universal
  `catch (err) { setX((err as Error).message) }` pattern used across the whole real renderer
  silently reads `undefined` on a Tauri rejection, with no thrown error and no console warning -
  just a UI that never shows the real failure text. Affects every error-display call site in
  every page this PoC has mounted, not just the one that happened to surface it. Fixed once,
  centrally, with `frontend/lib/tauriInvoke.ts`'s `wrapInvoke()`, applied to all six entry
  files' `invoke` bindings. See "A sixth real page" above for the full investigation.
- **A second instance of "a JSON-RPC response needs a concrete, non-`undefined` result"
  (above), caught only by actually driving the call end to end.** `backup.delete`/
  `backup.restore` mirror `deleteBackup()`/`restoreBackup()`'s own real `void` return - a real
  restore genuinely put a deleted file back on disk, but the response line itself carried
  neither `result` nor `error`, which the Rust side reads as a failure unconditionally. The
  real file being right there on disk is exactly why a type signature alone (`void`, same as
  `log.record`'s own handler originally had) doesn't surface this - only calling the RPC method
  and checking the actual response line does. See "A seventh real page" above.
- **The opposite direction of the same class of bug: a legitimate JSON `null` result is
  indistinguishable from no result at all, confirmed by deserializing both shapes side by side
  and comparing.** `#[serde(default)] result: Option<Value>` collapses `{"result": null}` and a
  response with no `"result"` key at all to the identical `None` - so `readUpdateLog()`'s real,
  honest `null` (a profile that's never been updated, the common case, not an edge case) read on
  the Rust side exactly like a sidecar bug. Fixed at the transport layer (a custom `Deserialize`
  reading the raw `Map` via `.get()`, which does preserve the distinction), not by wrapping every
  legitimately-nullable method's result - the same kind of per-call-site fix the two bullets
  above needed, which this one deliberately avoided needing again. See "An eighth real page"
  above.

## What this doesn't prove yet

- **~~Nothing about Windows specifically~~ - now built and run on real Windows too.** Confirmed
  working end to end (read, write, push event, all visually) via WebView2, after fixing two
  Windows-only build issues this surfaced: the MSVC linker (`error: linker 'link.exe' not
  found` without the "Desktop development with C++" Build Tools workload) and a missing
  `icons/icon.ico` (see "Running it"). The RAM numbers below are still Linux-only, though -
  that specific measurement still needs a real run on the Windows machine to mean anything.
- **~~Nothing about streaming~~ - the live console feed itself is now covered**, via the real
  `watchLogFile`/`parseLogChunkWithDate` (see "Result" above) - the stdin/stdout JSON-RPC shape
  does carry a continuous stream of small push events correctly, not just a single
  "entity changed" event. Still nothing about the other ~33 IPC modules specifically (group
  console, stats history, Discord bot status, ...), though they're the same two shapes
  (request/response or push) this PoC has now exercised at least once each.
- **~~Nothing about packaging/bundling the sidecar~~ - all three parts now proven**: the sidecar
  runs as one self-contained executable with no system `node` dependency (Node SEA); it's
  spawned through Tauri's real `bundle.externalBin`/`tauri-plugin-shell` sidecar mechanism, not
  a hardcoded path; and `cargo tauri build --bundles deb` genuinely bundles it into an
  installable `.deb` that runs correctly once `dpkg -i`'d for real - see "Sidecar packaging"
  above, specifically "Actually bundled and installed with `cargo tauri build`", which is also
  where a real crash-on-fresh-install bug got found and fixed. Still outstanding: code-signing
  and auto-update, and the equivalent bundling step on Windows (`.msi`/`.exe` via WiX/NSIS) and
  macOS (`.app`/`.dmg`) - only the Linux `.deb` target has been tried. `SIDECAR_PATH` is still a
  dev-time escape hatch for iterating without rebuilding the SEA binary each time.
- **~~Nothing about `shell.*` calls~~ - proven for `shell.openPath`, the only one any real file
  uses.** See "The reverse direction" above: the sidecar can call back into Rust for a real
  native action and get a real result (success or a real error string) back, through the same
  stdio pipe, with no change to the real file that calls it (`lib/systemFolders.ts`'s
  `openProfilesFolder()`, unmodified). This actually overturns this PoC's own earlier
  speculation in the table below - see the note under it.
- **~~Nothing about the bot sidecar~~ - proven, including a real bug and a validated fix.** See
  "The Discord bot subsystem" above: `lib/discordBot.ts` + `src/bot/` have no Electron coupling
  at all - but `fork()` silently can't spawn a different script from a Node SEA binary (it just
  relaunches the SEA binary's own embedded entry point instead), which would have broken the bot
  subsystem the moment the main sidecar ships as a SEA binary. Fixed with a small, tested,
  opt-in change to the real `discordBot.ts` (15 lines, zero behavior change when unset, existing
  test suite still green) - the *one* real file this whole PoC needed to actually modify, not
  just call unmodified.
- **~~Nothing about the webdashboard sidecar~~ - proven, and it isn't actually a separate
  sidecar at all.** See "The web dashboard subsystem" above: `lib/webDashboard.ts` (8200+
  lines) is an in-process `http.Server`/`https.Server` even in the real app, not a forked
  process like the bot, so none of the SEA/`fork()` problem applies. Confirmed with a real HTTP
  client against the real embedded dashboard page and a real `/api/servers` response, both
  standalone and through the actual compiled app via plain `curl` - and unlike the bot, nothing
  broke; it bundled and ran correctly on the first try despite pulling in a large slice of
  `src/main/lib/` transitively. All three subsystems from the original size estimate (main
  process logic, bot, web dashboard) are now proven.
- **~~Nothing about the real renderer~~ - proven for four real, unmodified pages across two
  subsystems, read-only, write-path, and live/polled.** See "A real React page", "A second real
  page", "A third real page", and "A fourth real page" above: `ManagerLogView.tsx` (read-only),
  `ProfileManagementView.tsx` (copy/move + a native dialog), `PlayerRosterPanel.tsx` (RCON
  roster/kick/ban, a different real subsystem entirely), and `PlayerWhitelistPanel.tsx`
  (tracking-only add/remove, no RCON), all completely unmodified, render correctly against a
  `window.api` shim built to the same surface the real preload already exposes, backed by
  Tauri's `invoke`/`listen` instead of Electron's `contextBridge`. Confirmed with real
  seeded/moved/written data through the real compiled app, screenshotted (including catching and
  fixing a wrapper-only mount-order bug the second page's screenshot surfaced - see "A second
  real page" - and a real correction to this PoC's own earlier "rendering dead end" finding,
  found while confirming the fourth page's write path - see "A fourth real page"). Still nothing
  about the rest of the real renderer - `App.tsx`'s routing/layout, Context providers, or any of
  the other ~26 pages, each touching a different (and in several cases much larger) slice of
  `window.api` than these four do - four pages across two different subsystems confirm the
  *shape* of the port generalizes past the easiest case, not that every page ports this cheaply.
- **~~Nothing about native OS dialogs~~ - proven architecturally, not proven end-to-end in this
  sandbox.** See "A second real page" above: `dialog_select_directory` is wired correctly (the
  command registers, compiles, and calling it visibly does something - a real dialog attempt, not
  a no-op), and it's the right architectural shape (a Rust-only command, matching the real
  `dialog.ts`'s own main-process-only design, no sidecar involved). What's unconfirmed is the
  happy path itself: `tauri-plugin-dialog`'s `blocking_pick_folder()` blocks indefinitely in this
  headless Xvfb sandbox waiting for a human click that can't happen unattended, unlike
  `shell.openPath`'s clean, fast failure. Needs a real desktop session (the same way the Windows
  numbers above needed a real machine) to confirm a folder actually gets picked and returned.
- **~~Nothing about starting/stopping a real server process~~ - proven, standalone and through
  the real compiled app.** See "The actual headline case" above: `startServer()`/`stopServer()`/
  `getStatus()` from `lib/serverProcess.ts` (980 lines, completely untouched until this round)
  spawn, track, and shut down a real OS process with no Electron coupling to shim at all. No real
  ARK/Minecraft dedicated server binary exists in this sandbox, so a test-only stand-in script
  stood in for one at the real, unmodified `getExecutablePath()`'s resolved path - confirmed with
  a genuine spawned PID, the real launch command line from `buildLaunchArgs()`, real
  `server-status` push events, and a real graceful-then-SIGTERM shutdown that left no orphaned
  process behind, both standalone (piping JSON-RPC directly into the SEA binary) and through the
  actual compiled Tauri app under Xvfb (confirmed via the real OS process list appearing then
  disappearing, not a screenshot). Found one real property of the unmodified shutdown code along
  the way: `stopServer()`'s "force kill" is a single SIGTERM with a 10-second give-up, not an
  escalation to SIGKILL - a process that ignored SIGTERM would be reported `stopped` without
  actually being dead. Still unconfirmed: the Windows-only ARK: Survival Evolved `.bat`-launch
  path. ~~No UI page calls any of this yet~~ - closed in "A fifth real page" below: the real
  `Dashboard.tsx` Start/Stop/Restart/Kill/Update buttons now drive this exact RPC layer (through
  the more complete `lib/serverActions.ts` orchestration, not `serverProcess.ts` directly - see
  that section), confirmed with a real click producing a real spawned/killed OS process through
  the actual compiled app, not just the RPC layer in isolation.
- **~~Nothing about surviving a Manager crash~~ - proven, with a genuine two-separate-app-process
  test, not a simulation of one.** See "Surviving a crash" above: `adoptPersistedProcesses()` is
  now wired into `sidecar.ts` at the same point the real `index.ts` calls it, and confirmed to
  correctly re-attach to a still-alive server process - both standalone (two separate sidecar
  processes, the second started after `SIGKILL`ing the first) and through the real compiled app
  (two separate `tauri_poc_shell` processes, the first `SIGKILL`ed outright, the second launched
  completely fresh). This also exercised `waitForExitOrKill`'s "adopted process" code branch for
  the first time in this PoC (`killByPid` instead of `child.kill()`) - a genuinely different
  shutdown path than the one `startServer()`/`stopServer()` within a single session uses.
- **~~Nothing about the multi-server spawn queue~~ - proven, with zero code changes.** See "The
  staggered multi-server spawn queue" above: starting two different profiles back to back showed
  the real, unmodified `reserveSpawnSlot()`/`queuedStatus` behavior - the second server's own
  `server.start` response carried no pid at all, and its real OS process didn't spawn until the
  real default 10-second stagger window had elapsed, confirmed against both the push-event timing
  and the real OS process list's own start timestamps (10 seconds apart, driven by the *first*
  server's `startedAt`, matching the function's own "global, not per-profile" queue design).
- **~~Nothing about a server actually finishing startup~~ - proven, standalone and through the
  real compiled app.** See "A server that actually finishes starting" above:
  `watchLogFileForMarker()`'s real `starting` → `running` transition, driven by the real
  startup-complete log line a real ARK server writes, not a timeout - the fake stand-in script
  gained an opt-in flag to write that same real line a few seconds after launch, the same kind
  of honest simulation `console.appendTestLine` already does elsewhere in this PoC. Found and
  fixed a real ordering bug in the test fixture itself along the way (not the port): writing the
  marker into a log file `watchLogFile` had never successfully polled even once got silently
  absorbed into its own first "establish a size baseline" tick and never reported - fixed by
  having the fixture create the log file immediately and append the marker only after a delay,
  matching a real server's own shape (log already exists and is growing before that line
  appears).
- **~~Nothing about player management~~ - proven, a different real subsystem from everything
  above, with one real, honestly-stated UI-reachability gap.** See "A third real page" above:
  `PlayerRosterPanel.tsx`, completely unmodified, renders a real server card against real data -
  `playerRoster.list` gracefully returning an empty roster, exactly matching the real handler's
  own RCON-failure fallback, not a stub. A real, fully successful write path (`playerWhitelist.
  add`, tracking-only, no RCON) was confirmed both standalone and through the real app (the real
  `config.json`'s `playerWhitelist` array gaining a real entry). Two more real, honestly-RCON-
  gated paths (`playerRoster.kick`, `playerBans.ban`) were confirmed standalone only, throwing
  the real `"No ServerAdminPassword..."` error `stopServer()` already surfaced - their real UI
  buttons only render inside a live roster row, which needs a real RCON-speaking server this
  sandbox can't provide, so that specific button-click path stays unconfirmed, same category of
  gap as the native folder picker's happy path. Also added the real `window_focus` command
  (`confirmAction()`'s focus-loss workaround), the second command in this PoC needing no sidecar
  at all.
- **~~Nothing about the real Start/Stop/Restart/Kill/Update buttons, or live push events actually
  reaching any webview~~ - both proven, and a PoC-wide bug fixed along the way.** See "A fifth
  real page" above: a real click on the real `Dashboard.tsx` buttons now drives a real OS process
  through `lib/serverActions.ts`'s orchestration layer (CPU/RAM monitor included, via a genuine
  `pidusage` reading), confirmed end to end including the process actually dying on screen and in
  `ps aux` together. Finding this required discovering that `src-tauri/capabilities/` had never
  existed in this PoC at all - every `window.__TAURI__.event.listen(...)` call, in every page,
  in every prior round, was being silently rejected by Tauri's permission system, which "A
  rendering dead end"'s original investigation mistook for a WebKitGTK compositing limit. Fixed
  with one `capabilities/default.json` file; re-confirmed the fix against that section's own
  original scenario, not just this round's new one. Also later confirmed: the live console feed
  (`listen('console-line', ...)`, `index.html`'s own test) through the real webview, the one
  push-event type in this PoC that had only ever been confirmed standalone - a real click on
  "Start watching the test log" then "Simulate a server writing a line" produced a real live
  update on screen, the same capabilities fix covering it too. ~~Per-group bulk actions never
  clicked~~ - also closed: a real click through the card menu's Group submenu (`setProfileGroup`,
  a real `profiles.save` write) moved a real profile into the already-registered "PoC Group," and
  that group's own bulk Start/Stop buttons (`startAll`/`stopAll`, the same `window.api.server.*`
  calls the single-card buttons use, just mapped over every profile in the group) correctly
  spawned and killed the real OS process, confirmed the same way as the single-card round - `ps
  aux` and the real status badge agreeing. ~~Drag-to-reorder never attempted~~ - also closed: real
  `DragEvent`s (`dragstart`/`dragover`/`drop`, a `DataTransfer` object required to construct them
  but never read by the handlers, which only track a `dragId` in component state) dispatched
  directly on two real card DOM nodes fired the real `onDragStart`/`onDrop` handlers, and the real
  `profiles.reorder` → `setProfileOrder()`/`reorderProfiles()` write landed - confirmed not just
  by the cards visibly swapping on screen but by the actual persisted profile order in
  `config.json` on disk afterward. Still unconfirmed: the Windows-only `.bat` launch path (same
  gap as above), and the "+ Add Profile" wizard (native dialogs, same gap as "A second real
  page") - the only two gaps left in this PoC that are architectural (need a real desktop
  session/Windows machine), not just "not yet clicked."
- **~~Nothing about stats history, backup scheduling, or build/version info~~ - proven, a sixth
  real page, with a PoC-wide bug fixed along the way.** See "A sixth real page" above:
  `AnalyticsTab.tsx` confirmed a genuine write-then-read round trip through `lib/statsHistory.ts`
  (real samples `monitor.ts` wrote, read back through the real chart's own data path), and found
  a second real-code wiring gap (`registerBackupScheduleWatcher()` never called) alongside the
  capabilities one from the previous round. The bigger finding: Tauri's `invoke()` rejects with
  a bare value, not an `Error`, breaking the `(err as Error).message` pattern every real
  component's error-display code uses - affecting every earlier page's own error UI too, not
  just this one, fixed once centrally rather than per-page. Still honestly unconfirmed in this
  sandbox: `UpdateCheckPanel`'s actual "update available" state, since nothing here ever arms
  the real background SteamCMD poller that would populate it - same category of gap as
  `doUpdateServer`'s own SteamCMD-not-installed error, not a new kind of limitation.
- **~~Nothing about world/player backups~~ - proven, a seventh real page, the heaviest write path
  in this PoC, and a response-shape bug fixed along the way.** See "A seventh real page" below:
  `BackupsTab.tsx` (plus the two real child components it mounts itself,
  `PlayerBackupsSection.tsx`/`BackupLogPanel.tsx`) confirmed a real create → real zip →
  real-event-driven list refresh → real select → real delete cycle, and a real restore that put a
  deleted file back on disk, all through the actual compiled app, not just standalone. Found and
  fixed a second instance of the exact class of bug "A JSON-RPC response needs a concrete,
  non-`undefined` result" already names: `backup.delete`/`backup.restore` mirror `deleteBackup()`/
  `restoreBackup()`'s own real `void` return, which always read on the Rust side as "neither a
  result nor an error" - an error, even on a genuine success - until both methods were given a
  concrete `{ ok: true }` return, the same fix `log.record` already needed.
- **~~Nothing about the SteamCMD update log~~ - proven, an eighth real page, and the opposite
  flavor of the same response-shape bug class.** See "An eighth real page" above:
  `UpdateLogTab.tsx` confirmed `readUpdateLog()`'s real, honest `null` result (every profile in
  this sandbox, since `updateServer()` never gets far enough to write a log without a real
  SteamCMD install) reaches the webview correctly as `null`, not a synthesized Rust-side error -
  found and fixed only because `Option<Value>`'s derived deserializer collapses a present JSON
  `null` the same as an absent field, confirmed by deserializing both shapes side by side. Also
  confirmed the live push path (`steamcmdUpdateEvents`/`onUpdateLogChanged`) through the real
  running app with a temporary test trigger, since no real SteamCMD run exists in this sandbox to
  drive it honestly.

## Where the real Electron coupling lives

Only two files are touched by Electron's `app` module in the startup path this PoC actually
exercises: `src/main/lib/dataDir.ts` (`app.getPath('documents')`) and `electron-store`'s own
internal default (`app.getPath('userData')`), both satisfied by `sidecar/electronShim.ts`'s
two-line stand-in.

A quick `grep -rl "from 'electron'" src/main/lib/` turns up 12 files total (out of ~80 in that
directory) - a cheap, worthwhile sanity check before assuming "keep 100% of the business logic"
is realistic beyond this one PoC's slice:

| What it imports | Files | Sidecar-portable? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `app` (`getPath`/`isPackaged`) | `dataDir.ts`, `appUpdater.ts`, `discordBot.ts`, `launchOnStartup.ts`, `webDashboard.ts`, `systemFolders.ts` | Yes - same `electronShim.ts` pattern as this PoC already proves |
| `shell` (`openPath` - `showItemInFolder` isn't actually called anywhere) | `backup.ts`, `mapManagement.ts`, `minecraftBackup.ts`, `minecraftMods.ts`, `playerBackup.ts`, `systemFolders.ts` | ~~Needs a real native call, not a stub - these particular calls would need to move to a Tauri command instead of staying in these files as-is~~ **Proven wrong by building it: sidecar-portable too, with zero changes to these files** - see "The reverse direction" above |
| `BrowserWindow` (type only) | `windowFocus.ts` | N/A - window-focus logic belongs in the shell anyway, not a sidecar concern |

So the actual finding is better than "two files": every `app.*` use across the whole `lib/`
directory is the same shape this PoC already handles, and every `shell.*` use turns out to be
the same shape too, once there's a real bidirectional channel - this table's own first guess
(struck through above rather than deleted) assumed `shell.*` call sites would need to move out
of these files and into a Tauri command, because "only the Rust shell can make the native
call." Building it showed that's not actually required: `electronShim.ts`'s `shell.openPath`
round-trips to Rust transparently, so `backup.ts`/`mapManagement.ts`/etc. would port completely
unmodified, exactly like every `app.*`-shaped file above - worth keeping the wrong guess
visible, not just the corrected answer.
